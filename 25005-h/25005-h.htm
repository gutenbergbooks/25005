<h2><a name="PROLOGUE" id="PROLOGUE"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">C</span>ome,</span> sit with me beside the broad
hearthstone and gaze into the
depths of the fire when it burns low, for
not among the leaping flames alone are
there to be seen marvelous things.</p>

<p>Deep hidden from your eyes at first,
but plainly visible as you look closer, are
countless forms of brightness and of
beauty. You will find them among the
shining coals that glimmer in scarlet
and gold before you when the embers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>lie clear and warm upon the hearth.
You will behold them among the shadows
that flit across the embers with delicate
grace and changeful hues.</p>

<p>Here, spread wide open, is a part of
the magical Land of Fire, the wonderland
of the good and peaceful Ember
Fairies. A golden gate gives entrance
to it. Shining pathways lead through
its bright gardens. Its skies are warm
and glowing. Here, decked with flaming
banners, stands the home of the good
Prince Ember&mdash;his fairy Palace of
Good Cheer. Here moves the beautiful
Shadow Princess, in trailing garments
of rose and amethyst. Here she
may be seen in her dance of joy and ecstasy
followed by her faithful band of
Shadows.</p>

<p>Long ago, in the Land of Shadows,
lived the Shadow Witch, the one beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>and loving creature in all that dim
and darksome land that lies away from
the Land of Fire, and between it and the
Chimney Back. Close to her domain is
the great Plain of Ash, where the giant,
Curling Smoke, rises, where the crafty
Ash Goblin lurks, where the boisterous
Wind in the Chimney swoops down
from out the Chimney Mouth. Near by,
also, in his Cave of Darkness, her
brother the Wizard works his enchantments.</p>

<p>If you will but hearken, I will tell you
how the Shadow Witch came to leave
that grim land with its evil fairies, and
why it is that she now dances with happiness
amid the good fairies of the Fire, in
the Land of Glowing Embers. You
shall hear, also, of the noble Prince Ember,
and of the quest upon which he once
set out. What speed he had in his high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>adventure, and whether or no he
brought it to a happy and fortunate
close, this tale will make known to you.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne</span> morning at early dawn, the
Shadow Witch stole down her
palace steps and out into her Garden
of Shadows, to walk there alone.</p>

<p>Not many days before, a stranger
prince, seeking to deliver a beautiful
flame princess whom he loved, had
passed through the Land of the Evil
Fairies that lies far away from the heart
of the Fire. The Shadow Witch had
seen him, and at first, half in mischief,
and half because she was lonely, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>tried, by her magic, to lure him away
from his quest into her own land. But
soon, moved by his courage and goodness,
yet most of all by his faithful love
to his princess, she had given him aid
in his undertaking, and had saved him
from destruction by her brother, the
Wizard of the Cave of Darkness.</p>

<p>No such bright visitant had ever before
come into the strange country
where she dwelt, and when he departed,
her dim palace, her misty woods and
gardens, even her own magic, no longer
gave her pleasure as they once had done.</p>

<p>Far from her dominions lay that
lovely land from whence the prince had
come, the land of the good and happy
Fire Fairies. Of the bright spells, the
noble magic, the joyous life of these
fairies she knew nothing.</p>

<p>Through her dusky land she moved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>attended by her servants, the Shadows,
working with them her curious, and
sometimes mischievous, spells. Her
brother, the Wizard, gave her no cheer,
spent no love upon her, taught her nothing
good, and she, for her own part, seldom
sought his presence.</p>

<p>As she walked this morning in her
garden, her dark eyes were troubled, and
she let her grey garments sweep the
ground unheeded, while in fancy she
followed Prince Radiance, who had
come for one brief hour into her dull
life. She could not but wonder whether
she must be always lonely as she now
was, whether she must always wish in
vain for such happiness as his land could
give. Up and down the alleys of the
garden she went, and for a long time no
one came to disturb her, but at length a
voice broke in upon her musings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>&ldquo;Mistress of the Shadows,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;a
messenger from your brother, the Wizard,
desires to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch lifted her eyes.
Before her stood her most faithful servant,
Creeping Shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is his message?&rdquo; the Shadow
Witch demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He declares that it is for your ear
alone,&rdquo; the Shadow answered.</p>

<p>Her mistress frowned impatiently.
She was in no mood to talk with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He waits at the palace door,&rdquo; continued
Creeping Shadow, &ldquo;and says that he
will remain there until you are pleased
to receive him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, then, and bring him hither,&rdquo; was
the reluctant answer. &ldquo;I will hear what
he has to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Creeping Shadow hastened to obey,
and presently returned accompanied by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>a dwarfed creature, black as the blackest
soot and clad in raiment as dusky as himself.
It was the Chief Imp, a trusted
messenger of the Wizard.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch especially disliked
him. He was at times impertinent
when he came on her brother&#8217;s errands,
therefore she held herself haughtily and
folded her robes closer about her when
he drew near.</p>

<p>But the Chief Imp bore himself
humbly today and his disagreeable face
wore an air of deep distress. He bowed
himself to the earth, and waited permission
to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What says your master?&rdquo; demanded
the Shadow Witch imperiously.
&ldquo;Speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; groaned the Imp, as if in profound
grief, &ldquo;My master lies in his cavern
sick unto death. He begs that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>will come to him, and, by your magic,
restore him to himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch regarded him unmoved.
&ldquo;Has so great a magician as my
brother no magic of his own that will
be potent to restore him, that he must ask
aid of mine?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; replied the Chief
Imp, rolling up his eyes, &ldquo;He has tried
every means within his power and grows
no better. He turns to you, therefore, in
his extremity and beseeches you not to
refuse him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knowing, as she did, the craftiness of
her brother, the Shadow Witch heard
his message with distrust. She knew
that if he had discovered that it was by
her help that the prince had escaped him
and that evil had been brought upon
himself, it would go hard with her once
she was in his power. Therefore, she determined,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>before she yielded to his request,
to learn from his servant whether
or not he suspected her of what she had
done. So she bent a searching gaze
upon the Chief Imp and began to question
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;what is
this sickness from which your master
suffers, and what is its cause?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Imp hastened to inform her. &ldquo;A
strange prince penetrated the Cave of
Darkness, a short time since. For reasons
of his own, the Wizard sought to
overpower him with the spell of his Urn
of Vapors, but the prince, who had come
upon him without warning, suddenly
flashed about him a magic weapon, the
Sword of Flames, that instantly took
from my master all power to protect
himself. He cried aloud to us, and at
once we hurried him away to an inner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>chamber, far from its dreadful sway.
There he lay for a time insensible, and
we feared for his life, but at length,
tended by his servants, he became able to
move a little, and, at last, even to speak.
But that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has become of this prince
and his magic sword?&rdquo; demanded the
Shadow Witch, watching him yet more
closely. &ldquo;Have you permitted him to
escape with it unharmed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madam,&rdquo; the Chief Imp replied,
&ldquo;When we came to seek him, to wreak
vengeance upon him, he had vanished
and had left no trace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had this prince no servants, no companions?&rdquo;
insisted she. &ldquo;None who
guided him to my brother&#8217;s cavern?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;the prince
was quite alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch asked him no further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>questions, but stood silent, pondering
deeply whether or no she should
grant the Wizard&#8217;s request. She herself
had seen him overcome by the fairy
sword, had seen the prince depart in
safety, but that her brother trusted to any
magic of her own to restore him, she
greatly doubted. Still, she believed that
there could be no grave danger to herself
in going to him. Never, even in the fulness
of his power, had he been able to
really injure her. Why should she fear
him now, when he was helpless. Besides,
from what the Imp had said, it was
not known that she had guided and protected
the prince. Therefore she had no
cause for uneasiness.</p>

<p>She turned to where the Chief Imp
waited, regarding her with his crafty
eyes. &ldquo;Go back to your master,&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>bade him. &ldquo;Say to him that I will come
shortly to render him what aid I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well pleased at the result of his errand,
the Chief Imp departed.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of sight
the Shadow Witch beckoned Creeping
Shadow to her side and instructed her
with lifted finger. &ldquo;I go alone to visit
my brother, the Wizard, who lies ill, and
has sent for me. If, however, much time
passes, and I have not returned, you may
be sure that some evil has befallen me.
Seek me then, instantly, in the Cave of
Darkness, for I shall have need of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Creeping Shadow swore to obey what
she had been told, and her mistress, gathering
her trailing robes over her arm,
took her way to the Wizard&#8217;s Cave.</p>

<p>Gloomy and forbidding was the Cave
of Darkness. Its outer walls rose high
and cliff-like from the great Plain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Ash, and a yawning opening led off to its
dark corridors and many dusky chambers.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch had no sooner
reached the Cave mouth and entered it
than the Chief Imp, with a spark lantern
in his hand, met her to conduct her to
his master. They passed swiftly down
the narrow passage and came presently
to that vast black chamber called the
Cave Hall, where the Wizard was wont
to sit.</p>

<p>The Cave Hall was filled with Imps,
some clustered in groups, whispering together;
some lolling idly upon the soot
cushions that lay about the floor; some
peeping stealthily from behind the
heavy curtains of soot with which the
walls were hung. But their master was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The Chief Imp went directly to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>farther wall and struck upon it with his
wand. Instantly it yawned apart, and an
inner corridor was revealed.</p>

<p>This part of the cave was strange to
the Shadow Witch, but she entered
boldly and followed her guide without
fear through many winding ways and secret
chambers, until at last he paused before
a second wall. He struck upon it,
as he had upon the other. It opened, in
its turn, and she saw before her a room
more profoundly dark than any that they
had yet passed through. Its charcoal
walls were set about with faintly glowing
lanterns, but so heavy were the soot
curtains that surrounded them that their
light was almost quenched.</p>

<p>Here, too, were Imps, one beside each
spark lantern, but in the centre of the
room the Shadow Witch saw that which
caused her to turn pale with misgiving,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>for the Wizard of the Cave was there&mdash;not
weak or ill, as she had been led to believe,
but recovered and standing in the
fulness of his strength.</p>

<p>Beholding him thus, she knew that he
intended mischief against her; knew,
also, that for her safety she must show
no sign of fear. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;my own magic will protect me. Never
has it been less potent than his. It will
not fail me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lifted herself to her full height
and stood tall and beautiful before him,
her rich black hair falling like a mantle
over her shoulders, her eyes gleaming
like stars through the dusk. &ldquo;So, you
have deceived me, brother,&rdquo; she said
coldly. &ldquo;I might have known that it
would be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even as you have deceived me,&rdquo; retorted
the Wizard, bending a look of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>malice upon her. &ldquo;But you have been
clever once too often, my sister. Did
you think that I could not guess that it
was you who made it possible for the
stranger prince to steal upon me unawares
with his Sword of Flames? Do
I not know your trick of the moving curtain
of shadow? It was that which
screened him from my eyes until it was
too late for me to destroy him. It was
yourself who told him when to unsheath
his sword. It was you, then, who made
me suffer. But now my time has come to
repay you&mdash;to make you feel the wrath
of the Wizard of the Cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch laughed scornfully.
&ldquo;I fear you not,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Have I not magic of my own, ay, as
great even as yours, that will serve
to protect me against your enchantments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>I defy you, then, magician
though you are. You cannot harm me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her words were bold, but fear
clutched at her heart in spite of them.
Here in this deepest part of the Wizard&#8217;s
Cave, surrounded by his servants, and
distant from her own, what would become
of her if her magic failed before
his? She knew that it would be folly
to stay and test it. She determined to
escape while there was yet time.</p>

<p>With a rush she attempted to dart past
him, but in vain. He stretched his long
arms and caught her to him, and though
she struggled desperately against him,
he held her fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away with the lights,&rdquo; shouted the
Wizard hoarsely.</p>

<p>Obediently the Imps snatched the lanterns
from the walls and vanished with
them in haste, leaving the Shadow Witch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>alone with her brother, wrapped in
deepest darkness. By what means he
wrought upon her there she could not
tell, for she could neither see his face,
nor hear his words. She only knew that
suddenly all her magic powers departed
from her, leaving her completely
helpless.</p>

<p>In her ears the harsh voice of the Wizard
sounded triumphing over her.
&ldquo;Thus you are repaid in part, my sister,
for giving aid to my enemies. It will be
long before you trick me again, for, lest
you should try to give me some fresh
proof of your cleverness, I have prepared
for you the darkness of this prison
chamber. In it no Shadow can have
power, can work magic. Here you
shall remain, until I choose to set you
free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He released her hands, and she sank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>weakly down to the floor of the cavern.
She heard his footsteps departing
through the darkness and presently she
knew that she was quite alone.</p>

<p>Lying where she had fallen, she
waited until a little strength came back to
her. Then she crept from side to side of
her prison, groping her way with her
hands, for she could see nothing. She
felt the heavy soot curtains sway beneath
her fingers; she felt the walls of charcoal,
hard and unyielding, behind them.
It was as if the room were sealed. Thus
she learned that there was no faintest
hope for her of escape&mdash;that she was, as
the Wizard had said, completely in his
power.</p>

<p>Yet she did not give way to despair, for
she knew that her servants were many
and faithful. &ldquo;I will wait patiently,&rdquo; she
whispered to herself. &ldquo;It cannot be long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>for Creeping Shadow will not forget
what I told her&mdash;will not fail to come to
my help.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">C</span>reeping Shadow</span> bore constantly
in mind the parting words
of her mistress, and when she had waited
patiently until many hours had passed
and still the Shadow Witch did not return,
she knew the time had come to go
in search of her. Saying nothing to her
fellow-servants of her errand, she set out
without further delay.</p>

<p>As she went through the garden and
out into the dim stretches of the Land of
Shadows, she kept careful watch, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>she might not overlook her dear mistress,
in case she should be approaching on her
homeward way.</p>

<p>She reached the Plain of Ash and
stood for a moment to scan it far and
wide. Only the grey expanse, dotted
with low hills and mounds of ash lay before
her. Not a living creature moved
upon its surface.</p>

<p>Sure then that mischief had indeed befallen
the Shadow Witch, she sped away
across the Plain, and with an anxiously
beating heart arrived at the entrance to
the Cave of Darkness. She plunged into
it. In the long corridor that led to the
Cave Hall, she met, from time to time,
Imps coming and going upon their
master&#8217;s business, and she hoped that
they might give her some news of her
mistress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she cried to one, &ldquo;Is my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>mistress, the Shadow Witch still in the
Cave?&rdquo; But the Imp laughed jeeringly
in her face and disappeared, making no
answer.</p>

<p>A second servant of the Wizard
passed her, and when she asked him the
same question, he gave her an impertinent
reply and vanished also.</p>

<p>More uneasy, then, than ever, because
of their behavior, she went on her way in
silence and came to the great Cave Hall.
Never before had she entered it alone.
In a huge chair, near to the farther wall,
she saw the Wizard sitting. His shaggy
brows were bent over a Book of Craft,
wherein were written all those ancient
and cruel spells in which he most delighted.
An evil vapor floated from the
pages of the book and, circling round his
head, half hid his grim face and dingy
beard. It crept along the folds of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>black garments and settled slowly about
his feet, veiling them in a yellow mist.</p>

<p>The Shadow beheld him with dread.
She feared to speak with him. But one
whom she loved was in danger. Without
making a sound, she drew nearer until
she stood directly before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Wizard,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I come to
seek my mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice, echoing through the silent
Cave Hall, roused the Wizard from his
evil studies. He threw back his head in
angry astonishment. &ldquo;You Shadows
grow impudent,&rdquo; he exclaimed frowning.
&ldquo;Who has given you leave to intrude
upon me in my Cave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of the indignant glance he cast
upon her, Creeping Shadow was not
daunted. &ldquo;I came to seek my mistress,&rdquo;
she repeated. &ldquo;She herself has bade me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>do so. Tell me, then, where I shall find
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seek her here in vain,&rdquo; declared
the Wizard. &ldquo;I will give you no news
of her, neither will I be disturbed. Begone
at once or it will be the worse for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but I must know what you
have done to her,&rdquo; persisted Creeping
Shadow. &ldquo;It was to follow the Chief
Imp, whom you sent, that she left her
Garden of Shadows. It was here that
she bade me seek her if she did not return.
The time has been long, and I
have come to obey her commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sharp eyes of the Wizard flashed
with wrath. &ldquo;What if she be here?&rdquo; he
thundered, smiting shut his Book of
Craft. &ldquo;She is my sister, and when she
offends me I shall punish her as I choose.
Learn the truth then. She lies hidden in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>the deepest part of my cavern, in a dungeon
so dark that she can work none of
her grey magic therein; in a dungeon
so remote that none of her servants can
ever penetrate to it; a dungeon whose
walls are so tightly sealed, so cleverly
enchanted, that she will try in vain to
make her escape. There she shall remain
until I choose to set her free. I have
told you. Go now, and let me see your
face no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words, so remorseless and
cruel, a wailing cry broke from the lips
of Creeping Shadow. Even a worse fate
than she had feared had overtaken the
beautiful Shadow Witch. She threw herself
in anguish at the Wizard&#8217;s feet to
plead with him for the release of her mistress,
but he would not hear her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, as I bade you,&rdquo; he commanded,
spurning her from him with force. &ldquo;Go,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>lest I summon my servants to bind you
fast, and place you in a prison as drear
and lonely as hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Creeping Shadow saw that there was
no hope, that nothing would move his
hard heart to mercy. Moreover, his
threat overwhelmed her with terror, for
if she herself were imprisoned, there
would be none to bring help to her mistress,
since none but herself knew that
she was in the Cave of Darkness.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, and with bowed
head passed from the Cave Hall without
another word. Her heart was very
heavy, for at first she could think of no
one to whom she could turn for assistance.
The Shadows, without their mistress,
were powerless against the Wizard.
All others in the land were not only as
wicked as he, as she well knew, but every
one of them, Curling Smoke, the Giant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>of the Seven Hills of Ash, the Dragon of
the Gloomy Vale, and the Ash Goblin,
would be instantly ready to join with him
against his sister. From the Wind in the
Chimney, also, nothing but ill usage
could be expected.</p>

<p>The more she pondered, the deeper
grew her despair, and every moment lost
was precious. She wrung her hands in
her distress.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly she remembered one
who was not evil&mdash;one who would surely
befriend the Shadow Witch. It was the
Elf&mdash;the good Elf, who dwells in the
Borderland that stretches beyond the
Plain of Ash and away toward the Kingdom
of Earth. Very old and wise is the
Elf. He knows the ways of the Evil
Fairies who dwell in the countries that
lie away from the heart of the Fire;
knows much of their dark magic and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>mischievous enchantments. He knows
something, also, of the good Fire Fairies
and their bright spells. Safe in his home
amid the ash of the Borderland, he sees
the Wind in the Chimney swoop down
upon the Borderland and even out across
the broad Hearthstone in his boldness,
but he knows no fear of him. He sees
the giant, Curling Smoke, rise stealthily
from his lurking places, sees him grow
vaster, and vaster, until, when he chooses
he darkens all the sky, but of him, also,
he is unafraid. The Ash Goblin creeps
forth from his low dwelling, prying into
the affairs of others and seeking what
mischief he may do, but the Elf goes his
way undisturbed, knowing himself secure
against him.</p>

<p>No one who comes to the Elf of the
Borderland for help in any good deed
comes in vain. Thinking of this, hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>rose in the breast of Creeping Shadow.
Sure that he would not fail her, she determined
to appeal to him at once.</p>

<p>Like an arrow she sped out of the Cave
and swept down the cliff-side and across
the Plain in noiseless haste. The Ash
Goblin met her, and would have detained
her to ask her business, but she
escaped him without reply. In trembling
fear of the Wind, who might swoop
down upon her, she approached the
Chimney Mouth, but she had the good
fortune to pass by it in safety.</p>

<p>She had entered the Borderland and
was not far from the Elf&#8217;s door, when
suddenly she encountered him. He was
sitting quietly upon a mound of ash, a
curious little figure, with eyes that
twinkled with a kindly light under thick
fuzzy brows. His fuzzy ears stood out
from beneath a peaked cap; his pudgy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>hands were almost hidden by the sleeves
of the soft ashen garment that clothed
him from head to foot.</p>

<p>He saw Creeping Shadow approaching
and knowing at once from her face
that she was in trouble, he guessed that
she had come to ask his help. So he beckoned
her to a seat beside him and listened
to her story with the keenest attention,
hearing her through to the last word
without interrupting her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Creeping Shadow besought
him, when she had told him all,
&ldquo;What can be done to deliver my dear
mistress? There is none so wise and kind
as yourself. Advise me, I beg of you.&rdquo;
With eyes fastened eagerly upon his face
she awaited his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is but one thing to do,&rdquo; returned
the Elf instantly. &ldquo;You must obtain
the assistance of some noble Prince&mdash;one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>who, by the power of his good
magic, can overcome the Wizard, and
set her free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed Creeping Shadow,
&ldquo;Where might such a prince be found?
You know as well as I that all in this land
are evil and use evil enchantments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;From this
land no help can come for the Shadow
Witch. But you must not forget the
Land of Fire. In it there are many good
and powerful fairies, and among them is
Prince Radiance. You must go to him
and tell him of this desperate plight of
your mistress. He will not refuse to
come to her relief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Creeping Shadow shook her head
slowly. &ldquo;I cannot believe that he will do
so,&rdquo; she asserted, &ldquo;for not long since my
mistress caused him great distress and
disappointment by leading him astray.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>&ldquo;Ay, that she did,&rdquo; agreed her companion.
&ldquo;But she made amends for it
immediately afterward by rendering
him a noble service. He himself told me
of it with gratitude. I am certain that
he has not forgotten it and will be glad
to repay his great debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So confidently did the Elf speak that
Creeping Shadow took heart once more.
She rose quickly from her seat. &ldquo;If you
will but tell me where to find him, I will
go and appeal to him at once,&rdquo; she declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must seek him in King Red
Flame&#8217;s dominions, in the Palace of
Burning Coals,&rdquo; the Elf instructed her.
&ldquo;There he dwells with his bride, the
lovely Princess White Flame, whom he
delivered from the enchantment of the
wicked Earth Fairy. Whether or no he
is able to come himself to the rescue of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>your mistress, remains to be discovered,
but this much is certain: he will see to it
that she is not left a prisoner in the hands
of her brother the Wizard. And now,
come. I will conduct you to the boundaries
of the Land of Fire. Once you
enter its dominions you will find many
friends, for its fairies are kind and gentle
and will do everything in their power
to guide you in safety to your journey&#8217;s
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cheered and consoled by his words,
Creeping Shadow set out in his company,
and when at length she thanked
the good Elf and bade him farewell on
the borders of the Land of Fire, she was
able to go forward alone with hope and
confidence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the Land of the Fire Fairies great
happiness reigned. Only a little
while before Prince Radiance had
brought the lovely Princess White
Flame safely home to her father, after
many perilous and strange adventures,
and King Red Flame had rewarded the
noble Prince with his daughter&#8217;s hand.
In the King&#8217;s marvelous palace, the Palace
of Burning Coals, their fairy wedding
had been celebrated with outbursts
of joy and exultation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>In the very heart of the King&#8217;s dominions
stood the palace, perfect in beauty,
from its dazzling foundations to its topmost
flaming turret. Brightness unquenchable
shone from its walls, warmth
and the spirit of friendliness streamed
from its windows and wide-flung golden
doors. Beyond it, in the garden of the
Princess, the exquisite flame-roses and
stately fire-lilies unfolded to a richer,
fuller beauty. The huge fire-oak, under
which Prince Radiance had first beheld
the enchanted Princess as a fine white
flame, rustled its ruddy leaves and
glowed more intensely from root to
crown, almost as though it knew and rejoiced
in the part which it had played in
the fortunes of this happy wedded pair.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole kingdom a
gentle music filled the warm air and
charmed the ear&mdash;the music of fairy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>voices, the music of whispering flames,
the music of tripping feet&mdash;all the
sweet sounds of the fire gathered into one
continuous strain of gladness, now high
and clear, as if it could not be restrained,
now low and soft, as if even in quietness
all must still murmur the praise of the
King and his beloved children.</p>

<p>Into this land of wondrous light and
beauty came Creeping Shadow, marveling
at what she saw, awed by it, stirred
by it, sure in her heart that from a place
so bright, so pure, so lovely, help must
come for her imprisoned mistress. The
Elf of the Borderland had spoken truly:
from the moment she had entered the
Land of the Fire Fairies, she had met
with nothing but kindness. The fairies
had looked with wonder upon this
stranger with the sorrowful face and
trailing robes of grey, but all had helped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>her on her journey, and none had asked
her more than she had cared to tell.</p>

<p>Twilight had come when, foot-sore
and weary, she reached the Palace of
Burning Coals. The palace gardens,
lovely in the softened glow of evening,
were deserted; the fire-lilies stood tall
and lonely by the garden paths; but from
every window of the palace streamed
brilliant lights, and from its doorway
floated sounds of joy and laughter. It
was that pleasant hour of evening in
which the fairies, their tasks in fields
and house and garden completed, came
freely to the palace hall to dance and
sing and tell, in the King&#8217;s presence,
tales of past adventure and noble deeds.</p>

<p>Creeping Shadow stood timidly at the
gate for a moment, longing yet fearing
to enter. How could she dare to hope
that the Prince would turn from a place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>so bright and joyous to come to the aid of
her mistress in a drear and dangerous
land?</p>

<p>But the need of the Shadow Witch was
too great to be set aside. Her servant
cast off her fears and stole silently
through the garden and up to the radiant
door. Pausing on its threshold, her dark
eyes traveled straight down the palace
hall to the vast room that opened beyond,
and there, upon a tall golden throne,
King Red Flame sat. At his right hand
stood he whom she had come to seek.
She remembered him well, that brave
and handsome Prince, whom her mistress
had for a time deluded by her magic
in the Land of Shadows. His yellow
locks fell as softly over his shoulders, his
noble countenance wore the same high
look of courage and good cheer as on
that day. His scarlet velvet cloak and cap,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>his waving feather, were the very same.
Close beside him was the Princess, in
shining robes, with floating hair of the
palest gold. Never before had the
Shadow seen her, but from her charming
face, so tender and beautiful, she knew
that it could be none else, knew, also,
that no cry for help and pity could come
to her in vain.</p>

<p>Gathering her grey robes closer about
her, Creeping Shadow entered boldly,
and sped through the hall. Groups of
gaily chattering fire-fairies saw this
strange visitant flit by them, but were
too startled and amazed to check her as
she passed. So she came unhindered
into the presence of the royal company.</p>

<p>But before she had reached them, the
Princess saw her. With a low cry of terror,
she caught the Prince&#8217;s hand. &ldquo;See
Radiance! See who comes!&rdquo; she whispered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>tremulously. &ldquo;Is not this one
from that grim land where we once
wandered so long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Prince saw her also and
knew her to be a servant of the Shadow
Witch, yet before he could answer,
Creeping Shadow had reached them and
had thrown herself at King Red Flame&#8217;s
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear me, oh, King,&rdquo; she implored,
&ldquo;I am Creeping Shadow. I come not to
bring evil, but to beseech aid from
Prince Radiance for my mistress, the
Shadow Witch, who is now in bitter
trouble, and who not long since was a
true friend to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Touched by the sorrow in her voice,
King Red Flame gave gracious answer.
&ldquo;Arise, Creeping Shadow, and speak
without fear. I give my royal word that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>whatever we can do to succor your mistress
shall surely be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Radiance stooped down and
himself raised the Shadow to her feet.
&ldquo;Your mistress was indeed my friend,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;I can never forget my
debt to her. Tell us quickly, what is this
trouble that has befallen her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To their words the Princess White
Flame added gently, &ldquo;Yes, tell us, for not
my Prince alone, but my father and myself,
also, are debtors to the Shadow
Witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus cheered and encouraged, Creeping
Shadow began her tale, surrounded
by the pitying fairies, all eager to show
their sympathy for her and their desire
to befriend her.</p>

<p>When all was told, Prince Radiance,
without waiting for the King to speak,
cried at once, &ldquo;Your Majesty, my duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>is plain. The Shadow Witch must not
be left to suffer punishment because of
me. Let me go at once to her rescue.
With my Sword of Flames, by which I
so lately conquered the Wizard, I can
again put him to naught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment the King made no answer.
At the generous words of the
Prince, a sob of joy broke from Creeping
Shadow, but Princess White Flame
shuddered. In memory she saw again
the dark cavern of the Wizard, remembered
its cruel master, and the evil spell
by which he had endeavored to destroy
her Prince; and for a brief space she
forgot the sore trouble of the Shadow
Witch, helpless and in that Wizard&#8217;s
power. It was but for an instant, however;
then her voice, tender and full of
sympathy arose, quivering though it was
with her fears for the safety of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Prince. &ldquo;Ah, no! We cannot let her
suffer! You must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come quickly then,&rdquo; breathed
Creeping Shadow. &ldquo;Come, while there
is yet time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the Prince could make further
answer to her plea, King Red Flame
interposed with firm, yet gentle, authority.
&ldquo;Stay, my son. In so grave a matter
we must take no step amiss. We must
seek the best counsel that our kingdom
affords. The Wise One alone, out of his
great store of wisdom, will know how to
give it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With lifted hand he summoned his
swiftest messenger. &ldquo;Go, Rushing
Flame,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Say to the
Wise One that the King has need of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In haste Rushing Flame departed, and
in a deep silence, broken only now and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>then by the low whispering of the fire
fairies, all awaited the coming of the
Wise One.</p>

<p>So ready was the Wise One to give
counsel wherever it was required, that
much sooner than could have been expected
from one of his age, he stood
before the King. Creeping Shadow,
lifting her eyes eagerly, beheld a very
ancient fairy, clad in deep scarlet. His
beard was white as snow. His eyes were
piercingly keen. Never had she seen
anyone who looked at once so ancient
and so wise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the Wise One
gravely, making him a low obeisance,
&ldquo;How can I serve you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me of your good counsel,&rdquo;
King Red Flame besought him. &ldquo;Far
away in the cave of her brother, the
Wizard, the Shadow Witch lies imprisoned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>not for any fault of hers, but
for her kindness to Prince Radiance and
my beloved daughter. Her servant
Creeping Shadow, whom you see yonder,
has come to beg the Prince to haste
to her deliverance. What say you?
If he goes, will he have power to deliver
her? If he goes, will he return in
safety?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anxiously Princess White Flame
fixed her eyes upon the Wise One&#8217;s face,
and awaited his answer to her father&#8217;s
question. No less anxiously did Creeping
Shadow listen to hear the fate of her
dear mistress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied the
Wise One, with great earnestness,
&ldquo;deeply as the Prince is indebted to the
Shadow Witch, brave though he is and
potent as is his Sword of Flames against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>the Wizard, it is not given to him to deliver
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hearing his words, tears rushed to the
eyes of Creeping Shadow. &ldquo;Alas! alas!
My poor mistress!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;If this
be true, what is to become of her in the
dense darkness where she lies captive
with all her magic power gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low murmur of pity ran from one to
the other of the kind-hearted fire fairies,
from the King himself, to the humblest
fairy gathered there.</p>

<p>Princess White Flame laid a consoling
hand upon Creeping Shadow&#8217;s
shoulder. &ldquo;Wait but a moment,&rdquo; she
told her. &ldquo;The Wise One has great
knowledge, great wisdom. No magic is
hid from him. Somewhere there must
be one who can bring succor to your
mistress. The Wise One will know of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>him, and can tell us where he may be
found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak truly, my Princess,&rdquo; the
Wise One hastened to inform her. &ldquo;It
is written in my Book of Wisdom that
when this misfortune falls upon the
Shadow Witch, there is but one who can
release her from that enchanted chamber
where the Wizard now holds her, but
one who can bring her unharmed
through the perils which will afterward
beset her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name?&rdquo; cried the King, Prince
Radiance and the Princess, in one voice.
&ldquo;His name?&rdquo; cried Creeping Shadow
beseechingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, it is your nephew, Prince Ember,&rdquo;
declared the Wise One. &ldquo;He it is
who is fated to set her free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From all those who had waited in
breathless suspense for his answer, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>burst a murmur of intense relief. Creeping
Shadow&#8217;s heart beat quick with joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the perils of which you spoke,&mdash;shall
my dear nephew, also, escape
them unscathed?&rdquo; demanded King
Red Flame anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, truly, Your Majesty,&rdquo; the ancient
one assured him. &ldquo;All will be well,
if he but follows my advice. Send him
to me, and I will instruct him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His counsel given, the Wise One bade
farewell to his master and returned to his
hut.</p>

<p>Once more Rushing Flame set out in
haste on the King&#8217;s business, but this
time it was to summon Prince Ember,
that he might learn from the royal lips
the task that was his to perform.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">B</span>eautiful</span> is the Land of Glowing
Embers, near to the Palace of
King Red Flame. When morning
dawns, a light soft and rosy bathes its
castles and its gardens. At noonday, its
pale sweet glow burns to a richer glory,
and a flush of deepest rose ascends over
turrets and blossoming trees. With nightfall,
a purple splendor settles over all
things while its peaceful fairies sleep.
Set in the midst of it is the home of Prince
Ember, the fairy palace of Good Cheer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>In his favorite room in the palace
Prince Ember sat alone, in deep thought.
Spread open upon the table before him
was a thick volume, written in the ancient
fairy language, filled with tales of fairy
adventure of a far off time. As he read
and pondered them, his heart was filled
with longing that he, too, might go upon
some dangerous quest, might win some
noble victory. His domain was quiet.
His servants were happy and at peace.
He knew of nothing that could call him
forth.</p>

<p>Tall and straight of limb and very
handsome was this prince of the Land of
Glowing Embers. Ruddy gold was his
hair, like the fire when it glows most
richly. His eyes were bright and kind.
The cloak that hung from his shoulders
was deep red and fell over red garments
of yet deeper hue. From his round red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>cap a black feather drooped to mingle
with the glory of his hair.</p>

<p>As yet he had no princess, for as yet
he had seen none who stirred his
heart, though for want of her he was
sometimes lonely, even in his Palace of
Good Cheer.</p>

<p>The fairies of his dominions loved him
well and served him with zeal, for none
was kinder, none more nobly just, than
their own Prince Ember.</p>

<p>Sitting in his palace on this summer
evening, he remembered the brave deeds
which Prince Radiance had lately done,&mdash;deeds
not less splendid than these
which were written in this ancient book.</p>

<p>And while he sighed, because he felt
that for him there could be no such high
adventures, Rushing Flame was speeding
toward his palace, on the errand of
the King. The messenger gave no heed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>in his swift passing, to the loveliness of
the land, but turning neither to right nor
left, came straight to the arched and
golden gate that gave entrance to the
gardens of the Prince.</p>

<p>Like an arrow he sped through it and
on to the palace door. An Ember Fairy
opened to his knock and, when he told
his business, led him quickly to the
Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; he announced,
&ldquo;Rushing Flame is here, with a message
from the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak, Rushing Flame,&rdquo; commanded
the Prince. &ldquo;What word do you bring
me from His Majesty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you will come to him at once,&rdquo;
the messenger replied. &ldquo;There are important
matters that require your presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&ldquo;Know you aught of what these matters
may be?&rdquo; demanded Prince Ember.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This much only I may tell you, Your
Highness. They concern a dangerous
and difficult adventure. More than this
you must learn from the King himself,&rdquo;
answered Rushing Flame.</p>

<p>Prince Ember sprang to his feet, his
eyes kindling with eagerness. &ldquo;See that
my horse is brought quickly to the palace
door,&rdquo; he cried to the Ember Fairy, who
still lingered near, &ldquo;for I go in haste to
my uncle, the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fairy obeyed, and presently the
hoof-beats of the ruddy charger that bore
the Prince resounded on the road that led
to the Palace of Burning Coals.</p>

<p>A good steed and a swift, was he. Before
Rushing Flame, with all his speed,
had gone half the distance homeward,
the Prince alighted at the door of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>uncle&#8217;s palace and a moment later presented
himself before the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear Ember,&rdquo; exclaimed
King Red Flame, grasping his hand,
&ldquo;your presence is most earnestly desired,
for there has come to us a servant of the
Shadow Witch, beseeching help for her
mistress, who now lies captive to her
brother, the Wizard of the Cave of Darkness.
This punishment he inflicts upon
her, because of her kindness to Prince
Radiance and my daughter. Gladly
would Prince Radiance prove his gratitude
by hasting to her deliverance, but
the Wise One has declared that it would
be in vain&mdash;has declared that it is yourself,
and none other, who is fated to set
her free. Since this is so, is it your desire
to go upon this adventure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Your Majesty!&rdquo; cried Prince
Ember, his countenance glowing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>ardor, &ldquo;no task could be more welcome.
I am ready to set forth immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King was greatly pleased, and
Creeping Shadow, her anxious fears at
rest, bowed herself at Prince Ember&#8217;s
feet in gratitude too deep for speech.
The hearts of Prince Radiance and Princess
White Flame overflowed with joy
since the deliverance of the Shadow
Witch seemed now assured, and their
happiness was reflected in the faces of
all the fairies gathered there.</p>

<p>King Red Flame spoke again. &ldquo;That
your success in this adventure may be
made certain, you must first go to the
Wise One and receive his instructions.
If you obey them, he assures me that you
cannot fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give good heed to them,&rdquo;
Prince Ember promised him.</p>

<p>So saying he took his leave and followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>by Creeping Shadow, set out on
foot for the home of the Wise One.</p>

<p>The queer little hut where the Wise
One lived was not far off, and soon they
stood before its door. Creeping Shadow
looked with astonishment at its bright
red walls, covered with magic inscriptions,
whose meaning was hidden from
all but the Wise One. She beheld with
amazement the chimneys, like lighted
torches, that topped its roof and the blazing
flame-bushes that surrounded it.
When the Prince knocked on the
quaintly carved door and entered at the
Wise One&#8217;s word, she drew back quickly
and seated herself under a flame-bush
until he should again appear.</p>

<p>Within the hut the Prince found the
aged fairy awaiting him. &ldquo;Hail, Prince
Ember,&rdquo; said he, rising to greet him.
&ldquo;You go upon a noble quest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&ldquo;I go gladly,&rdquo; replied the Prince, and
the words came from his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not go unprepared,&rdquo; returned
the Wise One. &ldquo;Upon those fairy
gifts that you carry with you, upon the
use that you make of them, the success
of your adventure depends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what shall these gifts be?&rdquo; inquired
the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First of all, a sword,&rdquo; was the instant
answer. &ldquo;A fairy sword of power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed the Prince. &ldquo;That I
do not possess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can be provided,&rdquo; returned the
Wise One, smiling. He stepped to an
ancient chest, deeply carved with mystic
signs, that stood quite by itself in a
corner of the hut. From out that chest
many magic gifts had come, when need
was great. Filled to the brim with treasures
as it always was, none saw aught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>within but those gifts which were for his
own use.</p>

<p>The Wise One bent down and fitted a
key in the lock. After its manner the key
turned of itself in the lock; after its manner
the lid rose of itself upon its huge
hinges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the Wise One, &ldquo;and behold
your sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Ember stepped quickly to his
side. Before his eyes, close sheathed in
its shining scabbard, lay the fairy sword
of power. A thrill of awe passed through
him at the sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; commanded the Wise One.</p>

<p>The Prince lifted it out, and as he unsheathed
it, at the Wise One&#8217;s word, it
filled the hut with a burning glow. Heat,
intense and ardent, streamed from it,
making warm the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the Sword of Fire,&rdquo; the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>fairy told him. &ldquo;As potent it will
be in your hands and for your use, as was
the Sword of Flames in the hands of
Prince Radiance. In every danger that
you must meet, over every obstacle that
you must encounter, save one, it will be
victorious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Ember&#8217;s heart beat fast. &ldquo;And
for that other?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For that, also, I have a gift,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;Look within the chest once
more and you will see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning down the Prince peered into
the dimness of the chest. &ldquo;There is a
small round box,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it, and open it,&rdquo; commanded
the Wise One.</p>

<p>Obediently Prince Ember drew it
forth and undid its clasp. He looked
within and saw a bit of charcoal, black
and glistening; nothing more. He regarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>it with astonishment. &ldquo;What
power has this to help me?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its power is great,&rdquo; returned the
Wise One, gravely. &ldquo;Guard it with care.
When escape for yourself and for the
Shadow Witch seems impossible, take it
out, and cast it boldly into the midst of
the danger that threatens you, and by its
good spell your way to safety will be
made clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince thanked him. He closed
the box, and placed it carefully in his
breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order that you may succeed in this
undertaking,&rdquo; continued his adviser,
&ldquo;you must be able to reach the prison of
the Shadow Witch unseen. You know,
as well as I, that among the good fairies
of the Fire, only the Ember Fairies have
power to become entirely invisible.
Within the Wizard&#8217;s Cave your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>magic will serve to make you so, but in
the Plain outside you must have the
Cloak of Ash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, also, you will give me?&rdquo; demanded
the Prince with quickening
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I have it not,&rdquo; answered the
Wise One, shaking his head. &ldquo;Only the
Elf of the Borderland can bestow this
upon you, for he alone, together with his
elves, possesses the secret of its making.
Moreover it must be woven in the presence
of him who is to wear it; otherwise
it has no power. Go to him and ask it.
He will not refuse you. Creeping
Shadow, who knows where he is to be
found, will guide you to him. Do in all
things as I have advised you, and you
will not fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Prince Ember, with grateful words
bade the Wise One good-bye and departed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>with his gifts, and as he left the
hut, Creeping Shadow arose from her
seat beneath the flame-bush and came to
walk beside him and guide him to the
Borderland.</p>

<p>Quite alone, in the Borderland, stands
the house of the good grey Elf. Its door
was fast shut and its windows closed
when Prince Ember and Creeping
Shadow approached it. The thick thatch
of ash which covered its roof and came
low down upon its walls so concealed
it from view, that had he been without his
companion to guide him, the Prince
might have sought for it long in vain.</p>

<p>When they had reached it, Creeping
Shadow stood still. &ldquo;This is the house
of the Elf,&rdquo; she said. Then, turning,
she pointed to a high black cliff that rose
in the distance. &ldquo;And yonder is the
Cave of Darkness, where the Wizard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>dwells, and my poor mistress lies imprisoned.
As soon as you have left the Elf,
lose no time in reaching her, I beg of
you, for the Wizard is very cruel, and I
know not what he may do to her if help
is long delayed. When you have climbed
the steep path which leads up the cliff-side,
you will behold the entrance to the
cavern yawning before you. As for myself,
I shall return now to the Land of
Shadows, to await in hope the homecoming
of my mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned again and struck upon the
Elf&#8217;s door thrice. It was the signal of
the servants of the Shadow Witch. In
silence the door swung open, and the
Prince set his foot upon the threshold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell, noble and generous
Prince,&rdquo; murmured Creeping Shadow.
&ldquo;Good speed, and a safe return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; said Prince Ember. &ldquo;Rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>confident that I shall bring home the
Shadow Witch in triumph.&rdquo; He passed
within, and as silently as it had opened,
the door closed upon him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>lone,</span> in the deep darkness of her
prison, sat the Shadow Witch
growing paler and sadder every day.
She was beginning to fear that after all
Creeping Shadow could do nothing to
help her, for how could she ever penetrate
to this dungeon, with its thick walls
that hemmed her in. She doubted not
that the Wizard kept the entrance to the
Cave closely guarded; indeed he had
told her that it was so.</p>

<p>Daily her food was brought to her by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>the Chief Imp, who grew more and more
impertinent to her. Daily her brother
came to taunt her with her weakness&mdash;with
his own power over her. Proudly as
she bore herself, she could not but dread
his coming, could not but wonder what
he might still have in store for her of
punishment and suffering.</p>

<p>Never before had she so hated the evil
magic of the Wizard and his friends;
and even her own magic, which she had
always used more in mischief than with
evil in her heart, had grown detestable
to her.</p>

<p>The longing to escape became so great
that she could hardly endure it, but with
each visit from her brother, her hope of
freedom became less and less, so scornfully
did he laugh at her when she demanded
to know when she should be set
at liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>One day, as she sat thinking bitterly
of the hardness of her lot, she heard once
again the sound of approaching footsteps,
and, immediately after, the wall
parted, and her brother entered. The
lanterns of the Imps who came with him,
cast but a dim light in the thick darkness,
yet faint as it was, the Shadow Witch
felt herself revive a little. She gathered
up all her strength and rose to face the
Wizard defiantly. In silence the Imps
flocked in and ranged themselves along
the soot-hung walls. The Wizard advanced
toward his sister with his cruel
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my clever sister,&rdquo; he asked her
jeeringly, &ldquo;how fares it with you now, in
this pleasant resting-place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dark eyes of the Shadow Witch
rested coldly upon his face, but she
vouchsafed him no reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&ldquo;Here, it is true, you have no special
opportunity to do further mischief,&rdquo; continued
the Wizard, &ldquo;and that is a hardship
for you, to be sure. But you have
plenty of time for repentance, which you
need far more. As for your Land of
Shadows, word has come to me that your
servant, Black Shadow, holds sway in
your absence. Nay, more, that she rejoices
in her power, and is none too eager
for your return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still the Shadow Witch made no reply.
She did not doubt what he said, for she
knew well the boldness and insolence of
Black Shadow, but she would not
gratify him by showing that she cared
in the least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Creeping Shadow,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;that other servant in whom, above all
the rest, you have had confidence, she,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>also, has joined herself to Black Shadow,
and obeys her in all things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that I know you speak falsely,&rdquo; retorted
the Shadow Witch. &ldquo;There is
none more faithful to me than Creeping
Shadow. Nothing could turn her away
from her loyalty to me. I have many
other servants, also who love me, and
serve me well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not show herself loyal when
she sought me in my Cave not long
since,&rdquo; observed the Wizard, stroking
his dingy beard with a slow hand. &ldquo;At
first she did indeed pretend to desire your
freedom; at first she wept and pleaded
with me for your release, as though she
were in earnest, but when she found that
I gave no heed to her, she cast off all
disguise, and showed plainly that she rejoiced
in your imprisonment. She
even went so far as to try to bargain with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>me to hold you here. She needed not to
bargain, my good sister, for nothing
could change my purpose toward yourself.
I have determined that in this
prison you shall find all of home or kingdom
that will be yours for many a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naught that you can say would serve
to convince me that Creeping Shadow
is a traitor,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Why should
I trust your word in place of what I know
of her? The day of my deliverance may
be far off, the way of its accomplishment
may be hard, but I shall be freed at last.
For this my faithful servants work, as
you shall find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still the Wizard sought to stir her, to
break down her courage. &ldquo;How unfortunate
it is that you have no prince to
aid in this good work,&rdquo; he taunted.
&ldquo;Such a prince as Radiance, perhaps&mdash;he,
whom you ran such risks to aid. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>he has returned to the Land of Fire with
his pale princess and will hardly trouble
himself now to release you from the punishment
that you are enduring because
of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Proudly the Shadow Witch raised her
head, and for the first time since her imprisonment
there were tears in her beautiful
eyes. &ldquo;Whether or no he remembers
me in the midst of his joy,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;Whether or no he will succor
me in my need, I shall never be sorry that
I helped him to deliver his Princess. He
it was who first brought brightness into
my dreary land. He it was, who, for the
first time in my life, made me to know
what it is to be noble. Happy am I, then,
even here and now, that it was given me
to serve him. Proud am I with a far
different pride than any that I have
known before.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>The Wizard heard her in amaze. Had
his sister taken leave of her senses?
What had come over the mischief-loving
Shadow Witch that she should speak in
this fashion? &ldquo;You behave strangely,
sister,&rdquo; he replied sharply. &ldquo;Can it be
that it was something more than the mere
pleasure of outwitting and injuring me
that led you to aid this impudent stranger,
enemy to your people and to all who
dwell in this land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; returned the Shadow Witch
boldly. &ldquo;It was indeed something more.
I could not see one so brave and good become
the victim of your evil magic; nor
allow his happiness to be destroyed by
those wicked ones who plotted for his destruction.
He has awakened me to what
we are, and I tell you now that if once I
escape from the power of your dark
spell, I shall bid you and your friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>farewell forever. If in my own Land of
Shadows I can cause to spring up a
better magic than it has known heretofore,
it will be well. But if that hope
proves vain, I shall forsake my home,
and go to that land of brightness and
good magic from whence this prince
came, and there learn nobler ways and
find a truer home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words of his sister, the Wizard
burst forth in such furious rage that
his Imps, hearing, shrank back close to
the wall of the cavern, trembling
with fright. &ldquo;Miserable creature,&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;Is it not enough that you have
brought suffering upon me, that you
should go to the Land of Fire, carrying
with you the secrets of all who dwell in
this land? Traitor! Until now I had
meant to punish you but for a time; but
now I know that to release you is to prepare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>misfortune and betrayal for every
one of us. It shall never, never be. You
have warned me in time. You have
sealed your own doom. Never, while I
have power to keep you within these
walls, shall you escape to carry out your
purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well say while you have
power to keep me,&rdquo; retorted the Shadow
Witch. &ldquo;Do what you may, I shall yet
be freed. Then I shall go where I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still more enraged by her unshaken
defiance, the Wizard sprang upon her
and grasped her wrists. He towered
above her dark and forbidding. He gave
a sharp command to the Imps, and in an
instant they had departed with the lanterns.
In the thick darkness that followed,
the Shadow Witch heard him say
nothing more, but she felt that same
strange magic stream from his hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>that she had felt on the day that she had
first entered her prison, and she became
as weak and helpless as she did before.</p>

<p>When he had gone and the wall had
closed behind him, she fell to weeping
wildly; not for Prince Radiance, whom
she should see no more, but for that
noble brightness that he had once
brought to her eyes, and with the dread
in her heart that it would never be hers.</p>

<p>Yet, even as she wept, ever nearer and
nearer to the Cave of Darkness came
Prince Ember, hasting from the Land of
Fire upon the glorious adventure of her
deliverance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> one thing the Wizard had spoken
truly: Black Shadow was a faithless
servant. As yet she had not dared to attempt
to rule over her fellow-servants,
but she longed for such power and was
always hoping that some day she might
obtain it. In her heart she rebelled
against her mistress; she would rebel
outwardly when it was safe to do so.
After a long time had passed and still the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Shadow Witch had not returned, she began
to believe that some evil had overtaken
her, and if she could have been
certain of it, it would have pleased her
well.</p>

<p>Her companions, becoming alarmed
at the prolonged absence of their mistress,
had sought for her diligently in
every part of her dominions, but at last
they had been compelled to give up
the search. They knew that Creeping
Shadow also had departed, though upon
what errand they could not guess. Now
they waited in mournful silence, beneath
the overhanging trees of the garden,
hoping that they soon might have tidings
of them both.</p>

<p>Leaving them there Black Shadow
walked apart, and as she walked she pondered
ceaselessly as to how soon she
might venture to snatch at some part at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>least of the power she so greatly desired.</p>

<p>Creeping Shadow, on her homeward
way, drawing nigh to the garden, saw
her dark figure stealing solitary among
the dim alleys, her head bent upon her
breast, as if in painful thought, but she
could not see her face. &ldquo;She grieves for
the absence of our dear mistress,&rdquo; said
the faithful servant to herself. &ldquo;How rejoiced
she will be to hear of her approaching
deliverance.&rdquo; She called to
her consolingly: &ldquo;Black Shadow! Oh,
Black Shadow! I bring good news!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hearing the voice, Black Shadow
raised her head. Her face, which till
then had been free from grief or anxiety,
changed suddenly to that of one who had
sorrowed deeply, and who for the first
time hopes. &ldquo;Good news?&rdquo; cried she.
&ldquo;Ah, if it comes from our mistress, tell it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>quickly! We have mourned her absence
so bitterly and so long!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With such eagerness did she speak, so
sincere was the sound of her voice, that
Creeping Shadow did not suspect her of
deceit, but made haste to tell her of her
visit to the Wizard&#8217;s Cave, and of all that
had happened since that time.</p>

<p>Black Shadow drank in every word
and pretended to be overjoyed. &ldquo;What
is this gift which the Prince is to receive
from the Elf of the Borderland?&rdquo; she
asked curiously when Creeping Shadow
ceased to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not told me,&rdquo; replied
Creeping Shadow. &ldquo;My duty was but to
lead him to the Elf&#8217;s door and there leave
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her companion bit her lip with vexation,
because she was unable to discover
the business that had taken Prince Ember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>to the Elf. The knowledge would
have meant much to her, if she could
have gained possession of it. She said
nothing more about the matter, however,
but asked many questions concerning
the Prince, and Creeping Shadow, suspecting
no evil, told her all that she
could, without reserve.</p>

<p>When Black Shadow saw that she had
learned all that her companion had to
tell, she laid her hand upon her arm.
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;We must tell the
others. They, no less than ourselves,
have grieved over the absence of our
dearly loved mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Creeping Shadow was but too eager to
do so, and they set out at once. They had
gone but a little way when they came
upon all the rest of the Shadows, still sitting
beneath the trees, talking sadly
among themselves with hushed voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>When their fellow-servants saw the
two approaching they sprang quickly to
their feet and hurried toward them, hoping
that at last tidings of the Shadow
Witch had come.</p>

<p>Creeping Shadow could not contain
herself until they met, but called to them,
&ldquo;Rejoice! Rejoice, for soon our mistress
will return to us again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this glad news they all broke forth
into joyful cries and rushed to her side
with rapid and excited questions, and no
sooner had she begun to answer them
than Black Shadow, seizing her opportunity,
slipped silently away from them
and losing herself among the trees, stole
unobserved out of the garden.</p>

<p>With all speed she took her way to the
steep cliff that led to the Cave of Darkness;
swiftly and steadily she mounted
it till she came to the mouth of the cavern.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>She entered without pause. Strictly
as it was guarded by the Imps whom the
Wizard had placed there, that none
might enter to bring help to the Shadow
Witch, no one of them challenged Black
Shadow. They knew her and her ways&mdash;knew,
also, that whatever might be her
errand, she was always a welcome guest
to their master. An Imp at once came
to light her way, and she followed his
flickering lantern until she came out at
last into the Cave Hall.</p>

<p>There she beheld the Wizard deeply
engaged. He sat in his huge armchair
before a table, on which lay an ebony box
filled with those wands with which he
worked his darkest magic. He took up
the wands, one by one, and ran his
fingers over them carefully to test their
power and having satisfied himself that
they were in perfect order, he wrapped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>each one separately in a black cloth and
laid it back in its place within the casket.</p>

<p>The Imps were not allowed to come
nearer to these wands at any time than to
touch the carefully locked casket as they
bore it to and from its place in their master&#8217;s
treasure chamber, but they watched
the Wizard from a distance with eyes
that twinkled sharply with curiosity as
he sat handling them openly in their
presence.</p>

<p>Black Shadow drew near to him, and
the Wizard suddenly perceiving her,
swept the remaining wands together
abruptly and placed them in the casket
at once. He snapped the lid of it and
locked it with a small and twisted key
which he drew from his garments. This
done, he gave his attention to his visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your errand, Black
Shadow?&rdquo; he demanded, leaning back in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>his chair, and composing himself to
listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bring strange news,&rdquo; she replied,
taking the seat before him to which he
had waved her. &ldquo;Creeping Shadow has
returned from the Land of Fire, bringing
word that a prince is on his way to
deliver the Shadow Witch from your
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A prince?&rdquo; exclaimed the Wizard,
starting forward in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; answered Black Shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me not that it is Prince Radiance,&rdquo;
he cried vehemently, for anguish
seized him at the memory of the
Sword of Flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned she. &ldquo;It is a stranger
prince, Ember by name, who knows not
this land, nor the dangers which lie in
wait for him here. What weapons of defence
he possesses, or what his magic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>we cannot guess. This only I can tell
you, he is in the home of the Elf of the
Borderland at this moment, there to obtain,
perhaps, some gift, or some instruction
which will make him proof against
us. Whether or not Creeping Shadow
speaks falsely, she has declared to me
that she knows nothing concerning his
business with the Elf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no fear of anyone so small and
peaceable as the Elf of the Borderland,&rdquo;
laughed the Wizard contemptuously.
&ldquo;It could not be in his power to bestow a
gift of any worth. As for the prince&mdash;my
servants shall redouble their vigilance
at the Cave Mouth. He cannot
pass them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not too sure of that,&rdquo; Black
Shadow warned him. &ldquo;Of the magic of
these fairies of the Fire we know nothing.
If he possesses some enchantment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>by which he can pass your guards unseen,
if he should find and liberate your
sister, and escape with her from your
Cave&mdash;what then? Shall one who has
foiled you thus be allowed to return unmolested
to his own land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a short space the Wizard sat
plunged in thought, for he knew well
that beyond the boundaries of his Cave
he had no power. But presently he
spoke. &ldquo;I have friends who will prevent
that,&rdquo; he declared confidently. &ldquo;Curling
Smoke waits but the word to engage
himself against any who come from the
Land of Fire. The Ash Goblin needs no
urging against my sister. Too often she
has made sport of him, until he has not
known which way to turn for anger.
And as to the Wind in the Chimney,
merely to speak to him is to gain his consent
to swoop down at once upon any adventurer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>into our lands. Seek these
friends of mine, Black Shadow, and bid
them lie in wait for this bold prince. Say
to them that the Wizard of the Cave relies
upon their aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Black Shadow rose, well pleased.
With all hope of liberty for the Shadow
Witch destroyed, she saw her way to
power. &ldquo;I will be your willing messenger,&rdquo;
she said. She turned away and
followed by the piercing glances of the
Imps, she left the Cave Hall, and a little
later again passed by the guards at the
Cave Mouth and came into the open
country without.</p>

<p>There she glanced about her, hoping
to catch sight of those whom she sought.
She did not look in vain, for almost immediately
the giant, Curling Smoke, uncurled
his tall form from a deep chasm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>in the cliff close by and towered high
above her, blocking the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither do you go, Black Shadow?&rdquo;
demanded he haughtily. &ldquo;You cannot
pass until you answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to pass, for it is yourself
whom I seek,&rdquo; she returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it that you desire?&rdquo; he asked
ungraciously, for he was no friend to the
Shadow Witch and made naught of her
servants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bring a message from the Wizard
of the Cave,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;He desires
your assistance. Because of an ill turn
that she served him, he holds his sister
prisoner, and Creeping Shadow, knowing
that it would be vain to ask any of the
powerful ones in our own land to rescue
her, journeyed to the Land of Fire to ask
aid of Prince Radiance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the very mention of Prince Radiance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>whom he hated, Curling Smoke
twisted himself about in a violent rage.
&ldquo;Let him not dare to return here, lest I
make short work of him!&rdquo; he shouted
hoarsely. &ldquo;Let him not flatter himself
that he can escape me this time as he did
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not Prince Radiance who comes,
but another; that one, so Creeping
Shadow tells me, who alone is fated to set
the Shadow Witch free. Prince Ember
is his name, and even now he is close by,
in the house of the Elf of the Borderland,
there to receive from him, doubtless,
something which will aid him to deliver
my mistress, and make him proof
against any who assail him, or who may
seek to prevent his success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curling Smoke laughed loud and disdainfully.
&ldquo;What has the Elf to give
that could avail against me and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>magic?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You amuse me,
Black Shadow. Go to that weakling, the
Ash Goblin, with such tales, if you will,
but do not bring them to Curling
Smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I repeat only what has been told
me,&rdquo; returned Black Shadow. &ldquo;Whether
or not it is true, I know not. I have come
to you for one thing only&mdash;to obtain a
promise for the Wizard that you will engage
yourself against this prince, wherever
you may encounter him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Curling Smoke laughed, and
his huge shape swayed boastfully from
side to side. &ldquo;You have little need to
doubt my answer,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Do I
not hate these strangers from the Land of
Fire with all my heart? Am I not only
too eager for an excuse to do them harm?
Return, then, to the Wizard, and say to
him that he need have no fear that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>prince will escape me. Say to him that
Curling Smoke&mdash;greatest of all magicians,
promises that it shall not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This said, Curling Smoke settled
again into a cleft from whence he could
watch the entire Plain of Ash. No one
could approach him from thence without
being seen by him.</p>

<p>Black Shadow assured of the vigilance
of this powerful ally, departed at once
to seek the Ash Goblin, whose low mean
hovel stood at some distance away
among the ash mounds of the plain.</p>

<p>So despised is the Ash Goblin that few
ever seek his door, and when he heard
upon it the sharp knock of Black
Shadow, he started with surprise. He
crept across the dingy floor, and put his
bulging eye to the keyhole to peer
through, and discover who stood without.
His astonishment at seeing Black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>Shadow was great, for never had she
sought him out before, but he knew that
he had no reason to fear her, so he
opened to her at once.</p>

<p>She came in, and without waiting to be
invited sank down into a seat. The Ash
Goblin made fast the door, and as he did
so he turned his crafty head to her and
inquired her errand. She told him all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well may you come to me,&rdquo; he assured
her. &ldquo;I have long desired to revenge
myself upon your impudent mistress.
Often she has made sport of me
with her tricking shadows. Often she
has even dared to make my own form
flicker and dance before me&mdash;not as it
is&mdash;indeed, but twisted and misshapen to
please her own mischievous fancy.&rdquo; His
eyes glinted with malice, and Black
Shadow was well pleased to find him so
willing to give his help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&ldquo;Then I will count upon you,&rdquo; she
said rising. &ldquo;As I have told you, the
Prince is now in the Elf&#8217;s house. If you
are wise, you will go and hide yourself
near it, and seize your chance to attack
him as soon as he leaves its shelter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wizard need have no fear,&rdquo; retorted
the Ash Goblin. &ldquo;I will surely
not miss so good an opportunity to
avenge myself upon his sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This ally also having been gained,
Black Shadow bade him farewell, and
went to the Wind in the Chimney.</p>

<p>Wide is the Chimney Mouth, which
gives entrance to the Wind&#8217;s dwelling,
for a giant must come and go through it.
This entrance is dark, and yawning, and
perilous, and none dares enter it except
at the Wind&#8217;s will.</p>

<p>The voice of the Wind is loud when
he laughs in glee, but it is louder a thousandfold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>when he howls with rage, and
when he sweeps down from his high
seat in the Chimney and rushes out into
the lands beyond, whistling or shrieking
as he goes, he drives all before him,
whether they will or no.</p>

<p>Today the Wind rested in his home, on
the great rough bench which was his
favorite seat, and Black Shadow had but
to ask of the Breezes who loitered about
the Chimney Mouth whether she might
go into the Wind&#8217;s presence, to have her
request granted immediately. Seldom
did she trust herself to such boisterous
company, but the occasion was urgent.
So she entered, though not without some
uneasiness, and went on and up the
rough uneven way, till she reached the
huge cranny in the Chimney where the
Wind sat, humming a whining song to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>himself, as he lounged against the Chimney
wall.</p>

<p>He gave her no courteous greeting
when she stood before him, but stretched
his mighty arm and shoved her unceremoniously
into a seat not far from himself.
&ldquo;What do you come to ask of me?
Out with it quickly,&rdquo; he growled, with
some impatience, for Black Shadow had
not dared to speak at once, but sat in
silence for a moment considering how
best to deliver the message of the Wizard
so that it might meet with favor.</p>

<p>Thus commanded, however, she delayed
no longer and presently had told
her story to the end.</p>

<p>The Wind heard her with unconcealed
pleasure. &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; he howled,
puffing his round cheeks till they seemed
like to burst. &ldquo;We shall have great sport
with this bold prince when he ventures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>forth from the Elf&#8217;s dwelling. He shall
nowhere be safe from me, for I am the
Wind in the Chimney, and nothing stops
or stays me in what I set out to do.
Prince Ember has no magic that will be
proof against me, and so far as anything
that the Elf can do for him goes, I scorn
it.&rdquo; So confident was he that he laughed
till the Chimney shook and rattled, and
the soot that lined its walls fell thick over
the head and shoulders of his guest.</p>

<p>Hearing their master&#8217;s uproarious
laughter, the Breezes came stealing in to
discover its cause, but the Wind frowned
upon them and buffeted them to right
and left so sternly that they rushed
quickly out again without daring to
speak.</p>

<p>The Wind turned to Black Shadow.
&ldquo;Go back to the Wizard,&rdquo; he commanded
her gruffly. &ldquo;Tell him that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Chimney shall fall in ruins, and the
Wind himself become as the faintest of
his Breezes before this stranger prince
succeeds in his purpose of setting free
the Shadow Witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his mantle, he tossed his
great shaggy head and whistled loudly.
&ldquo;I am the Wind&mdash;the Wind in the Chimney!
Heugh, heugh! Ho, ho! Heugh,
heugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pursued by his braggart whistlings
and the hoarse echoings of his mirth,
Black Shadow left him and hurried back
to the Wizard&#8217;s Cave to make known to
him the success of her mission.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> Prince Ember said farewell
to Creeping Shadow and stepped
into the Elf&#8217;s house, he found himself in
a curious room whose walls were grey
with ash, whose floor was covered so
thick with it, that his feet sank into it,
and made no sound. It was as if he trod
on softest down.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room stood the
Elf, with pudgy hand extended. &ldquo;Welcome,
good Prince,&rdquo; he said heartily.
&ldquo;You come on the business of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Shadow Witch, for I know the knock of
her servant, Creeping Shadow. What is
it that you desire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am on my way to deliver the
Shadow Witch,&rdquo; the Prince made answer,
taking his hand. &ldquo;The Wise One
has bade me ask of you a certain marvelous
Cloak of Ash, to conceal me from
my enemies. He says that here only is
the secret of its making known, and that
you will not refuse to provide me with
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wise One has spoken truly,&rdquo; returned
the Elf, &ldquo;but he has doubtless
told you also that you must wait while
this Cloak is woven especially for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he has,&rdquo; replied Prince Ember.
&ldquo;But let it be done quickly, I beg of you,
for who can tell what the Shadow Witch
may suffer at the hands of her brother if
my coming be long delayed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&ldquo;Not a moment shall be lost,&rdquo; the Elf
assured him. Still holding him by the
hand, he drew him to a narrow door at
the farther end of the room. He opened
it, and revealed beyond it the Prince saw
a vast chamber, filled with elves hurrying
silently to and fro on tasks strange to
him. The moment their master entered
with Prince Ember, every elf stood still
ready to hear and obey whatever command
might be given to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the Weaver of the Cloak?&rdquo;
inquired the Elf. &ldquo;There is work for
him to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly a very ancient elf separated
himself from his companions, and came
to stand before the Elf of the Borderland.
&ldquo;I am ready, master,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Cloak is to be for this Prince,&rdquo;
the Elf told him. &ldquo;Use your best skill
in the weaving, so that it may be potent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>against his enemies, for much depends
upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not fail him, master,&rdquo; responded
the Weaver confidently. His
keen old eyes swept the Prince from
head to foot. He needed to take no other
measure. Then he turned to a dim loom
beside the wall, and standing before it,
he began to spread the fairy warp under
the watchful eye of the Elf. As he did so
the elves came hurrying noiselessly with
the magic ash which was to fill it.</p>

<p>Deftly the Weaver began to weave,
crooning the mystic weaving-song meanwhile,
so that the magic of its words might
sink into every part of the Cloak, and
make its power certain. He feared
not to weave it under the eyes of him
who should receive it, for he knew well
that he who wears the Cloak, may see
it woven, and hear the song, but no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>sooner has the Cloak fallen upon his
shoulders than he forgets what his eyes
had beheld and his ears heard. Thus the
secret of the ancient Weaver remains
with the elves of the Borderland.</p>

<p>Steadily the Cloak of Ash grew under
the skilful hands of the Weaver, steadily
the Prince watched the shuttle come
and go. Never once did the ancient
Weaver rest; never once did he cease to
sing his mystic song, nor did the elves
pause as they came and went, bringing
the magic ash for the Cloak&#8217;s fashioning.</p>

<p>At last the moment came when the
Weaver&#8217;s shuttle stopped, the song
ceased and the elves stood still. The Elf
turned to the Prince. &ldquo;The Cloak is finished,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>He bent down and lifted it soft and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>silvery from the loom, and Prince Ember
stretched eager hands to receive it.</p>

</div>

<!-- <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>[Blank Page]</p> -->

<p>&ldquo;Give heed to my words,&rdquo; the Elf admonished
him, as he delivered it to him.
&ldquo;In the Cave of Darkness only will you
be endangered by the spells of the Wizard
himself. There only he has power,
and he never leaves its shelter and the
weapons of enchantment which it contains.
But in the lands without he has
powerful and evil friends, who will not
be slow to help him against his enemies
if he desires it. From all but one of these
the Cloak will conceal you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Elf paused for a moment and then
went on more earnestly. &ldquo;Though your
foes will not behold you, yet you must
be on your guard against them, for who
can say what traps they may set for you,
what snares may await you. Beware,
therefore, of the Ash Goblin. He is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>small of stature, but he cannot safely be
despised, for he is very cunning. He
will not only assist the Wizard gladly because
he hates his sister, but for some
grudge, also, that he bears to the dwellers
in the Land of Fire, he will not fail to
wreak his spite on any who comes from
thence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not forget your warning,&rdquo;
Prince Ember promised him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware, also, of Curling Smoke,&rdquo; the
Elf continued. &ldquo;None more wicked and
dreadful than he inhabits the lands you
must pass through. He travels far and
wide, and because Prince Radiance
lately conquered and scattered him by
the power of his Sword of Flames, he has
vowed to be revenged upon one and all
who enter here from the land of the good
Fire Fairies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>Again Prince Ember assured him that
he would remember.</p>

<p>The Elf drew closer to him and laid
his hand upon the Prince&#8217;s arm. &ldquo;Beware,&rdquo;
he adjured him solemnly, &ldquo;Beware
of the Wind in the Chimney.
Against him only the Cloak may not protect
you. His eyes are keen to pierce disguises.
His hands are strong to break
down spells. See to it that he does not
snatch from you in an unguarded moment
this sheltering Cloak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more the Prince gave his promise,
and stretching his hands in gratitude
to the giver of so priceless a treasure,
poured out his thanks.</p>

<p>But the Elf checked him. &ldquo;Speak not
of it,&rdquo; he protested kindly. &ldquo;The elves
of the Borderland rejoice to have a part
in any noble undertaking. Only succeed,
and we are well repaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&ldquo;The Wise One has said that I shall
be victorious,&rdquo; declared the Prince confidently.
&ldquo;And when my task is done,
and the Shadow Witch has returned in
freedom to her own land, I shall preserve
as my chief treasure this marvelous
Cloak, which you have been at such
pains to weave for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Elf smiled and shook his head.
&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;None takes the
Cloak of Ash from the Borderland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will return it safe to your
hands,&rdquo; the Prince assured him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be no need,&rdquo; replied the
Elf, &ldquo;for the Cloak perishes when its
work is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words he led him from the
dim room where the marvel had been
wrought, and brought him to the outer
threshold of his house. There the Prince
bade him farewell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good fortune go with you,&rdquo; responded
the friendly Elf in a cautious
undertone. &ldquo;Put on the Cloak now, and
go forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In obedience to his words, Prince Ember
threw the Cloak about him and fastened
it securely. As its soft and delicate
folds enveloped him, the Cloak became
invisible at the same time that the Prince
himself became fully concealed by it.</p>

<p>He lifted the latch and opened the
door and passed silently out into the
Borderland.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Ash Goblin was filled with
pride. To have his assistance
asked by so powerful a magician as the
Wizard of the Cave was something that
had never before occurred. Although
he was small and weak, he was always
desirous of having a part in any mischief
that might be going on, and now that his
chance had come he was determined to
prove to all those who had hitherto despised
him and overlooked him, that his
cunning and skill in evil magic were
fully equal to their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Scarcely had the door of his hovel
closed upon Black Shadow than he
locked it securely. Then he hurried
across the room and pressed upon a certain
spot in the wall. It yielded to his
touch, and a portion of the wall slid back
upon itself, showing a small, rude cupboard
within. Upon a shelf there lay a
book, covered with dust. It was his Book
of Craft. He took it out and carried it
to a table. He undid the rough clasp
that bound the book and began to turn
the dingy pages. At length, he reached
the one whereon the spell that he sought
was written. The letters were crabbed
and dim with age, and the Ash Goblin
strained his eyes to see them, following
the words with his crooked forefinger.
He read the spell through carefully,
again and again, until he was certain
that he knew it by heart. Then he closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>the book and returned it to its hiding-place.
He made the wall fast again, and
went to the chest that held his pouch and
cloak. Taking them out, he carried the
pouch to the hearth and filled it to the
brim with the evil ash that lay thick
there. He bound the pouch about his
waist, covered himself from head to foot
with the cloak and left the hovel, closing
the door tightly, so that none could enter
in his absence.</p>

<p>The Plain of Ash stretches wide and
grey between the hovel of the Ash Goblin
and the Borderland where the Elf
dwells. In the Borderland itself no evil
fairy can practice his craft, but the Ash
Goblin knew a spot where the Plain
meets the Borderland, which all must
cross in passing from the Elf&#8217;s house to
the Wizard&#8217;s Cave, or from the Cave to
the Land of Shadows. At this spot he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>purposed to set a cunning snare for
Prince Ember.</p>

<p>Across the great Plain he scuttled in
haste. So like to the ashes about him
was he in color that only those who knew
him well would have been able to see
him at all. He held his head down, and
his hood was pulled low over his forehead,
but though his face was carefully
concealed, his sharp eyes peered out,
searching the Plain to see if the Prince
were anywhere about. But there was no
sign of him, and being satisfied that he
was still within the Elf&#8217;s dwelling, the
Ash Goblin went rapidly to the spot
which he had chosen, with eyes fixed
upon the door through which the Prince
must come.</p>

<p>He had not quite reached the place,
when suddenly he saw the Elf&#8217;s door
opening slowly. Vexed that he had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>arrived in time, but knowing how great
a risk he should run if he were seen by
the Prince before the snare was set,
he dropped down quickly beside a hillock
of ash, where he could see without
being seen. There he would lie hidden
until Prince Ember had gone by on his
way to the Cave. After that he knew
he could make ready his snare at his leisure,
sure in his heart that if the Prince
were so fortunate as to escape the Wizard,
he could not fail to be entrapped by
the snare, when, as he must on his homeward
journey, he passed that way again.</p>

<p>But to his great surprise, although the
door opened wide, it remained so for a
moment only, and then closed again
silently without his having seen anyone
come out of it. Afraid to venture forth
immediately, he watched for a little
longer, but the door remained shut, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>finally the Ash Goblin came out from his
hiding-place and began to set his snare,
still keeping a watchful eye over the
Elf&#8217;s house as he did so.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, when the
Elf&#8217;s door had stood open, Prince Ember
had passed out of it, and concealed
by the Cloak of Ash, had proceeded on
his way to the Wizard&#8217;s Cave. The Ash
Goblin, on his own part, had been so
well hidden by the mound of ash where
he had crouched down, that the Prince
had passed close by him without having
perceived him.</p>

<p>So while the Ash Goblin worked
busily upon his snare, Prince Ember
traversed the Plain of Ash, keeping always
in view that black cliff toward
which Creeping Shadow had pointed before
she had left him. Even from a distance
it looked forbidding, yet the bold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>spirit of the Prince did not quail at the
thought of the unknown dangers that
awaited him there. Straight forward he
went over the long stretches of ash, past
high mounds and low grey hillocks, and
through shallow vales. As he journeyed
he remembered the Elf&#8217;s warning, and
would not have been surprised if he had
been set upon at any moment by any of
the foes that had been mentioned to him.
But a deep silence filled the Plain, and
nowhere did he see anything that could
molest him. Never had the Prince believed
that there could be a land so empty
and so lonely.</p>

<p>He arrived at the foot of the cliff and
began to mount the steep path that led
to the Cave&#8217;s mouth. Up and up he
went, still on his guard, but still seeing
no foe and hearing no sound. Now on
this side, now on that, deep and dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>crevices yawned, but his feet went surely
and safely on.</p>

<p>In one of these same crevices, Curling
Smoke lay hidden, peering out with
watchful eyes across the grey expanse,
to catch the first glimpse of the ruddy
stranger of whom Black Shadow had
told him, yet under his very eyes the
Prince was traveling and he saw him not.</p>

<p>At length Prince Ember reached the
entrance to the Wizard&#8217;s Cave. Standing
there, he looked first across the Plain
and then into the gloom of the cavern,
but no enemy was in sight. Quickly he
removed the Cloak of Ash and then, as
fairy raiment always may when fairy
fingers press it, it became as small as a
kerchief in his hand. He thrust it to a
place of safety in his belt.</p>

<p>If Curling Smoke had but leaned a
little farther out at that moment from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>dark hollow in the cliff-side where he
lay, he must surely have seen him, but
crouching low, so that he might not be
seen by the one for whom he watched, he
saw nothing and did not guess that the
Prince was actually within reach of his
giant arms.</p>

<p>So, guarded from all his enemies,
Prince Ember passed into the Cave of
Darkness, not knowing how well the
Elf&#8217;s good gift had already served him.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">C</span>lose</span> to the mouth of the Cave of
Darkness, but cleverly hidden
from the view of any passerby, sat a company
of Imps. They had been commanded
to keep ceaseless watch at that
point for the stranger Prince who was
expected soon to appear, and they were
instructed to seize him as soon as he attempted
to enter the Cave and to bring
him bound to their master.</p>

<p>The time had been long, and they were
now yawning for very weariness, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>they dared not relax their vigilance,
knowing, as they did, that they would be
severely punished by the Wizard if they
allowed the Prince to slip by them unobserved.</p>

<p>At last one of the Imps arose and
stretched himself, for his limbs were
cramped and stiff. &ldquo;I go to spy out over
the Plain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall be absent
but a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His companions nodded indifferently,
and he strolled slowly toward the entrance
of the cavern. All at once, he
stopped, transfixed with surprise, for at
the Cave Mouth he saw for a single instant
a richly glowing figure standing,
one who could be no other than the
stranger Prince, he for whom they
waited. Scarcely had he seen it, however,
than it disappeared.</p>

<p>He rushed back to his fellows. &ldquo;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>Prince is here!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.
&ldquo;I saw him at the Cave Mouth. To be
sure he has vanished, but I know he is
close by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Imps started to their feet, and
stood ready, the ropes of darkness with
which they were to bind the Prince
clutched firmly in their hands. But no
one appeared, and when they searched
the Cave Mouth, they did so in vain.</p>

<p>Presently they began to scoff at their
companion. &ldquo;Your eyes are wearied
with long watching,&rdquo; they told him.
&ldquo;They have played you false. Come not
to us with such idle tales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but I saw him,&rdquo; the Imp insisted.
&ldquo;Without doubt this Prince has
the power to make himself invisible.
Even now he may have slipped past us
unseen. If this be so, and I fail to tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>the Wizard what I saw, I shall surely be
punished. I go to warn him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others shrugged their shoulders.
&ldquo;Go if you choose,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;For our
own part, we think it not impossible that
he lurks in some near-by hiding-place,
from whence he steals forth at times,
watching his opportunity to slip in unobserved.
He saw you, and has retreated
to it. We will keep close watch
as before. He will return, and then we
will secure him. If, on the other hand,
he has power to make himself invisible,
and passes us unseen, we are not to
blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as they spoke thus, Prince Ember
stood near them, listening to their
words. It was as the first Imp had suspected.
On passing into the Cave of
Darkness, he had, by his own power of
enchantment, made himself invisible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>and having overheard the watchers talking
together, he had paused, so that the
Imp who had seen him might go before
him and without being aware of it,
would guide him directly to the Wizard.</p>

<p>The Imp did not stop to argue longer
with his companions, but snatched up a
lantern, and sped off at once, and close
behind him went the unseen Prince. As
they went onward, Prince Ember saw
opening to either side of them many
hushed and gloomy passageways, down
which, without his guide, he might easily
have strayed, but by his unexpected good
fortune, and far sooner than, at the beginning
of his journey, he had dared to
hope, he came suddenly into the great
Cave Hall. Its grim walls rose high on
all sides, close hung with their swaying
curtains of soot. The glistening fragments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>of charcoal that covered its floor,
lay like a thick carpet beneath the feet.</p>

<p>In the centre of the vast room stood
the Wizard, quite alone. Forbidding
enough in himself, clad as he was in long
black robes, over which his dingy beard
fell from his grim face almost to his feet,
he seemed yet more so because of the
huge black urns that were ranged about
him in a circle. The sides of the urns
were covered with curious inscriptions,
and only the Wizard knew by these signs
what deadly mists and vapors were confined
under their ponderous lids.</p>

<p>On a table at his side his case of evil
wands stood open, and as he needed the
one or the other for his enchantments, he
lifted it out and waved it over the urn
which he chose, muttering strange words
meanwhile in an unknown tongue. His
Book of Craft, also, lay open before him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>so that he might diligently consult it before
the working of each new spell. At
this moment he was bending above it,
wand in hand, reading intently.</p>

<p>Even in his zeal to disclose to his
master what had happened at the entrance
to the cavern, the Imp dared not
tread within that circle of enchantment.
He cast himself upon his knees without
it, bowed low his head, and cried aloud,
&ldquo;Sir Wizard, oh, Sir Wizard! Harken!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Interrupted in such unexpected fashion
while he was in the midst of his
wicked task, the Wizard turned abruptly
and bent upon his servant a glance of
dark displeasure. &ldquo;How dare you disturb
me in the working of my spells?&rdquo;
he thundered. &ldquo;Have I not strictly forbidden
any to tread within this Hall during
the Hour of Enchantments?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, that I should have ventured to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>disobey you, my master!&rdquo; stammered the
Imp with trembling voice. He knew
well the punishment that waited on disobedience,
yet he feared far more what
might be meted out to him if he should
withhold that which he had come to say.
&ldquo;Only the news I bring,&rdquo; he continued
humbly, &ldquo;could have made me disobey
your commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wizard perceived that this was a
matter of real importance. He laid
down his wand, therefore, and prepared
to listen. &ldquo;What is it that you have come
to tell?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>Encouraged thus, the Imp began.
&ldquo;As I stood near the Cave Mouth, I had
a sudden vision of a stranger in ruddy
garments. He stood at the entrance for
an instant only, but plain to be seen
against the light, and then vanished, I
know not whither. It may be that my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>eyes deceived me, for when we made diligent
search we could find no trace, but
it may be, also, that he has made himself
invisible, and is even now among us.
Lest it might be this stranger Prince, perchance,
for whom you bade us watch, I
have left my companions on guard as before,
while I came to tell you what I believe
that I beheld. I dared not do otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done wisely,&rdquo; commended
the Wizard. &ldquo;Without doubt it is the
Prince of whom Black Shadow has told
me, for she said that we may know him
by his ruddy garments. Whether or not
he has made himself invisible, he shall
not escape me. If he is here, I shall
surely find him out. Rise now, and return
to your watch with the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silently the Imp arose and obeyed.
Prince Ember standing but a little distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>from the mystic urns, heard his
swift footfalls echo down the corridor.</p>

<p>The Wizard stood for a moment
wrapped in thought, but presently he
laid down the wand which he held in his
hand and chose another from the case.
He raised it aloft and waved it in a great
circle above his head. &ldquo;By the power of
this wand,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I bid any who
stand invisible within this Cave Hall to
become visible at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he heard the words, Prince Ember&#8217;s
heart stood still. He knew not the
power of the Wizard&#8217;s wand, nor
whether his own magic would surely be
proof against it. But his own spell held
firm, and he remained invisible.</p>

<p>So certain was the Wizard of the potency
of his wand, that he smiled grimly
and confidently when he saw none appear.
Leaving the circle of his urns, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>stepped to the entrance to the corridor,
and drew his wand across it. &ldquo;Let none
pass this threshold unseen,&rdquo; he cried in
a loud voice.</p>

<p>Satisfied that he now had made all secure,
he returned, Prince Ember watching
him meanwhile. He took his place
amid the urns and replaced his wand in
the box with its fellows. He dropped
the lid and turned the key. He closed
and locked his Book of Craft, also.</p>

<p>Then he smote his hands together
sharply and, at the signal, the Chief Imp
came rushing to learn his desire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take away these urns,&rdquo; the Wizard
commanded, &ldquo;and place my wands and
book in safe-keeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chief Imp raised the Book of
Craft from the table and bearing it carefully
in his outstretched hands, disappeared
with it from the Hall. A moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>later he returned and carried away the
box of wands in the same manner. With
him came many Imps, who laid hands
upon the ponderous urns and with heavy
rumblings rolled them slowly away out
of the Cave Hall.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Prince Ember stood
still watchful beside the wall, waiting
for some clue which would guide him to
where the Shadow Witch lay imprisoned,
for he knew well that without this he
must surely go astray. He had not long
to wait, for when presently the Imps
came flocking back to the Cave Hall, as
they were always free to do when the
Hour of Enchantment was done, the
Wizard gave a sign to his lantern-bearers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go to visit my sister, the Shadow
Witch,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Immediately they snatched up their
lights and stood ready.</p>

<p>The Wizard crossed to the farther
end of the Cave Hall and touched the
wall with his wand. Prince Ember saw
the wall part instantly in twain, revealing
the dim corridor beyond it.</p>

<p>The Imps plunged quickly into it
holding aloft their flickering lanterns
that gave out but a feeble light in the
gloom. The Wizard strode after them,
and at his very side stole the Prince, overjoyed
at this sudden and unexpected opportunity.</p>

<p>The Wizard paused and touched the
wall again, and it closed soundlessly behind
them. Then they went forward.</p>

<p>Deep and yet deeper, into the very
heart of the Cave they penetrated, following
its dark and winding ways. The
Prince observed each turn closely, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>that when he should return bringing
with him the Shadow Witch, he might
find his way out without error.</p>

<p>At length they reached the wall that
barred her dungeon, and the Wizard
struck upon it as he had the other. It
yawned apart in its turn, and with such
impetuous zeal did Prince Ember hasten
toward the opening that he entered before
the rest the sombre prison that lay
within.</p>

<p>In the first moment he saw nothing,
but as the Imps pressed into the room
and ranged themselves along the walls,
he was enabled, by the light of their glimmering
lanterns to descry a dim bowed
figure seated there.</p>

<p>It was the Shadow Witch. Her face
was buried in her delicate hands. Her
long black hair hung loose over her
drooped shoulders and grey garments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>and fell in masses upon the ground.
Plunged as she was in deep despair, even
the opening of the wall had failed as yet
to make her sensible of the coming of her
brother and his servants.</p>

<p>Beholding her thus, Prince Ember was
stirred to deepest pity, and his heart
burned to speak some instant word of
comfort. With a powerful effort he restrained
himself, for to betray his presence
to the Wizard now would be to encounter
he knew not what evil power,
to endanger his chance of delivering her
whom he had come to save.</p>

<p>That which so moved the heart of the
Prince to compassion, awoke only malicious
delight in the Wizard&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my sister,&rdquo; he said mockingly,
drawing near to her, &ldquo;I find you less confident
today than when we last met.
Hope fades I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>His voice aroused her. She lifted her
head and raised herself slowly to her feet,
and as she turned herself toward the
Wizard, Prince Ember beheld her face
for the first time.</p>

<p>He looked upon its wondrous beauty,
he saw upon it the marks of the pain that
she had endured, he gazed into the splendor
of her great dark eyes, and love for
her rose within him like a flood, a love
so warm, so strong, that he knew instantly,
and for a certainty, that in her
he had found his true Princess, she
whom he could not choose but love with
his whole heart. Thrilled with joy because
of it, he waited for her voice.</p>

<p>Silvery calm it fell upon his ear as she
answered the Wizard. &ldquo;Though hope
may seem to fade for a moment, brother,
it rises fast and soon, for there is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>within my breast that tells me that you
cannot always hold me thus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would have given much had the
Wizard not found her sunken in despair,
but since he had done so, she was determined
that he should not guess how deep
that despair had been.</p>

<p>The Wizard smiled contemptuously at
her words, and added taunt to taunt. &ldquo;It
tells you, perchance, of that Prince, then,
who lingers near the Cave Mouth, seeking
entrance, in the belief, no doubt, that
he can succeed in snatching you from
this prison, and from my power. But let
him not deceive himself. My guards are
many and watchful&mdash;my friends without
are strong and clever. He will never be
able to escape all of these, try how he
may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch started violently
at such unexpected words. The help that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>she had yearned for had come! Prince
Radiance, to whom she had been so true
a friend, had not forsaken her in her
need! That hope, of which she had
boasted, and which had so nearly faded
from her heart, sprang again to fulness
of life. She threw up her arms in uncontrollable
rejoicing, and her voice rang
sweet and high and clear as she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Ah, he has come at last, the
good Prince Radiance! He has not
failed me! Think not that your guards
can stay him. Think not that your evil
friends are able to destroy him. He has
conquered them once&mdash;he will conquer
again. Already you yourself have felt
his mystic power. You shall feel it once
more, my brother, when he returns. I
have done well to hope!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, not so fast,&rdquo; the Wizard flung
at her scornfully. &ldquo;He who comes is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>Prince Radiance, but some stranger
prince. One who owes you no friendship,
whose power is untested, who has
no cause to brave great dangers for your
sake&mdash;grey woman that you are. From
the perils that he must meet he will soon
turn back, if indeed he live to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Undismayed, undiscouraged, the
Shadow Witch bent her dark eyes upon
him. &ldquo;What matter that he is a
stranger?&rdquo; she cried confidently. &ldquo;They
who come from that bright land count
themselves no strangers to the weak and
the defenceless. They have, too, their
own noble magic, before which ours is
powerless. In a moment when you think
not it will be upon you, and its spell will
overcome you. This prince is my friend!
I know it well! The hour of my deliverance
is at hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud rang the laughter of the Wizard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Harsh and vibrant it filled all the room
and echoed back from the gloomy walls.
&ldquo;Think you I would tell you of this
prince, did I not know that he cannot
reach you? Far hid from him are you,
my sister,&rdquo; he triumphed, &ldquo;so deep within
this Cave, and behind such walls as he
can never penetrate, whatever be his
magic. The secret that unlocks your
dungeon lies with me only, and with
those to whom I choose to entrust it. The
spell that holds it fast is the all-potent
spell of the Wizard of the Cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Proudly and boastfully he spoke, but
all that he might say had no power to
dim the hope and confidence of his sister.
She deigned him no reply, but by her
bearing he knew that she feared him not
at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I come again,&rdquo; he jeered at
her, &ldquo;I will bring you further news of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>this good prince, and how his adventure
fares. It will give you food for thought,
perchance, as you sit here in your darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will indeed sustain me, brother,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>

<p>Prince Ember, near to her, though unseen,
listening to her dauntless words,
loved her yet more for her high courage
and for her sorrowful beauty.</p>

<p>Still smiling scornfully, the Wizard
turned away. The Imps knowing that
he was now ready to depart, raised their
lanterns. Their master touched the wall.
It opened wide, and in an instant master
and slaves were gone, and the walls met
silently and grimly together behind
them. Beyond its barrier their retreating
footsteps grew fainter and yet fainter
until soon they could no longer be heard.</p>

<p>Alone, as she believed herself now to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>be, in the imprisoning darkness, the
Shadow Witch let fall her head and
sighed deeply. &ldquo;Ah, that the time may
not be long,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Ah, that
this prince might hasten his coming, for
I am very weary, even though I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then from the darkness near her came
a voice. &ldquo;Princess of the Shadows,&rdquo; it
breathed, &ldquo;I, Prince Ember am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the words her heart leapt within her
breast. She raised her head quickly,
thinking to pierce the blackness that surrounded
her and behold the one who
spoke. As she did so the gloom melted,
and in its place a soft warm glow flooded
all her prison. By its rich light she saw
before her a glorious figure, clad all in
deepest rose&mdash;Prince Ember, freed from
his dark disguise. The radiant brightness
of his ruddy garments made warmth
and light about him. His eyes, ardent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>and glowing, were bent upon her, filled
with a tenderness of sympathy and compassion,
with a fulness of love, that
struck to her soul. His hands were
stretched to her, his spirit drew her.</p>

</div>

<!-- <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>[Blank Page]</p> -->

<p>A cry of wonder broke from the lips
of the Shadow Witch. With her large
eyes fixed upon him, sorrow fled from
her face, and in its stead came joy where
joy had never dwelt before. How had he
come to her? she asked herself, to her in
this dark prison? How had he pierced
the thickness of those cruel walls? Why
should his eyes rest with love upon her,
the grey Shadow Witch? And yet it was
true&mdash;he was here, this glorious prince&mdash;come
to save her!</p>

<p>Her face dropped suddenly to her
quivering hands, lest it should betray to
him too plainly how her heart went out
to him, in love and gratitude. Radiance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>that first bright prince, had awaked her to
keenest longings for a nobler life, a truer
magic. But he who stood before her now
gave this, and more&mdash;gave love, brought
happiness.</p>

<p>The Prince came nearer till he was
close beside her, and as he did so, her
cheek, till now so pale, flushed to a crimson
glory against the dusky splendor of
her hair. Gently he drew away her
shielding hands and looked into her
lovely face, bright as none but he had
ever seen it. Gently he raised her drooping
head and looked into the sweetness
of her eyes. &ldquo;Dear Shadow Witch,&rdquo; he
whispered tenderly, &ldquo;come, ah, come
with me, and leave behind forever the
darkness of this evil place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Low was her voice and soft as she
made answer: &ldquo;Happy, thrice happy am
I, Prince Ember, that I may leave it with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> the Wizard parted from his
sister, he believed that she was
hopelessly in his power, but as he proceeded
on his way, he began to recall to
himself how defiantly she had borne herself
at the last, and with what confidence
she had spoken. He remembered, too,
how often she had baffled and eluded
him before he had imprisoned her, and
he knew that it was not entirely impossible
that she might do so again. Could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>she but release herself from the deep
darkness that surrounded her, all her
own magic would return to her, and
then, in spite of all his guards, she might
be able by means of one of her clever
tricks, to make her way to liberty.</p>

<p>Thinking of these things, he reached
a bend in the corridor where two ways
met. The one went directly on to the
Cave Hall, but the other led away into
that remote and dangerous part of the
cavern where lay the Pit of Fumes.
Thither he was wont to go to practice
his most secret arts. No Imps ever dared
to tread that way, for it was well known
that none but himself could pass over it
in safety.</p>

<p>He paused, for he suddenly bethought
himself of how easily he could, by a stroke
of enchantment, close with a wall the
way to the Cave Hall and leave only that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>one open which led to the Pit of Fumes.
Then if by some strange means his sister
should contrive to escape from her dungeon,
she would unsuspectingly go on to
the Pit of Fumes. This she would be unable
to pass, and would, therefore, be
forced to return to the prison that she
had left.</p>

<p>The Wizard laughed aloud, for the
thought pleased him well. He determined
to prepare this trap for her at once.
Abruptly he bade the Imps to rest their
lanterns. They did so and stood motionless
with eyes fixed on their master. The
Wizard bent on them his sternest gaze.
&ldquo;Let none dare to look upon that which
I am about to do,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>

<p>Immediately his slaves fell upon their
knees, and with eyes fast shut and heads
bowed to the dust, meekly awaited his
pleasure. It was as if they held their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>very breath, so deep was the silence of
the Cave.</p>

<p>From beneath his cloak the Wizard
drew his jet black wand. He waved it
toward the walls and repeated, in a voice
so low that none but himself could hear
them, strange words of enchantment.
Under their spell, the Cave walls began
to draw slowly together, and before long
they stood firmly closed across the way
by whence he had come.</p>

<p>Replacing his wand, the Wizard
turned to where his servants still knelt
with guarded eyes. &ldquo;Arise, and go forward,&rdquo;
he commanded them.</p>

<p>With one accord they sprang to their
feet, and without one glance behind to
discover what their master had done,
they went rapidly ahead of him.</p>

<p>While the Wizard departed in content,
Prince Ember made ready to open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>the dungeon of the Shadow Witch so
that she might go free. With her at his
side he stood before the thick wall that
barred the way to the corridor. He laid
his hand upon his fairy sword, and unsheathed
it. It glowed and burned with
living fire.</p>

<p>With its bright point he touched the
wall in that selfsame place where the
Wizard was wont to pass through, and
on its blackness he traced the scarlet outline
of a door.</p>

<p>Breathlessly the Shadow Witch followed
with her eyes the moving point of
fire, followed it till the outline was complete,
and the sword fell back into its
sheath. Without a word, but with
swiftly beating heart, she waited in her
place by Prince Ember&#8217;s side to see what
wondrous thing that sword could do.</p>

<p>Wondrous indeed, for silently and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>itself the door swung open, and the corridor
that led to freedom was before her.</p>

<p>Prince Ember took her hand, and together
they crossed the threshold, but
when they had passed it he paused, and
spoke one charmed word. As silently
as it had opened, the door closed behind
them at its creator&#8217;s command, and its
outlines vanished, leaving the wall the
grim unbroken barrier that it had been
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my good Prince!&rdquo; whispered the
Shadow Witch looking upon it. &ldquo;What
magic is yours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke no word in answer, but
raised her hand to his lips and kissed it.</p>

<p>Then they began their journey along
the windings of the corridor, that
stretched away and away into a gloom
that seemed to have no end. Yet the
place where they trod was bright about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>them, made so by the ruddy glow which
streamed from the figure of Prince
Ember. In the warmth and cheer of it
the Shadow Witch glided happily, and
as they left her prison farther and farther
behind, she became more and more her
former self, and again felt stirring to life
within her that old-time power of magic
of which she had been so long deprived.</p>

<p>They came at length to the wall which
the Wizard had set to mislead his sister.
Seeing nothing to arouse their suspicions,
they went straight on. After
traveling for some distance, however,
Prince Ember all at once became aware
that it was not the way over which
he had gone with the Wizard and his
servants. He stopped, and began to look
sharply about him. On every hand it
was unfamiliar to him.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch saw that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>troubled, but she could not guess the
reason. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we left the prison,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;we took the way by which I had
come to you. There was no other. But
now it is not the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been no place where we
could have turned aside,&rdquo; she assured
him. &ldquo;Nowhere has there appeared
any other way open to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet we have gone astray,&rdquo; the
Prince insisted. &ldquo;There can be no doubt
of it. All that I see now, I have never
seen before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure of it?&rdquo; asked his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes of the Shadow Witch flashed
with sudden understanding. &ldquo;It is the
enchantment of my brother,&rdquo; she declared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&ldquo;Lest, perhaps, I should escape
him, he has closed the true way, and left
this open as a trap for me. Be sure that
it leads not to the Cave Hall, except
through dangers into which he believes
that I will not dare to venture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be these dangers what they may,&rdquo; replied
Prince Ember, &ldquo;I will, by my good
magic, overcome them all. And now,
since there is no way but this, let us go
upon it without tarrying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, we cannot choose but take
it,&rdquo; agreed the Shadow Witch.</p>

<p>They resumed their journey, therefore,
and now, though the way behind
them had been gloomy, that which
stretched before them grew more and
more so; yet the darker it became about
them, the brighter was the glow that
streamed from Prince Ember, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>more surely was the Shadow Witch sustained
and cheered thereby.</p>

<p>After a while, they saw that they were
approaching an open space, which was
wrapped in thick darkness. Beyond it
their eyes could not penetrate, but in its
midst they beheld shapes like wreaths
of vapor arising from below.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch turned pale, and
caught Prince Ember by the arm to draw
him back. &ldquo;Go no farther!&rdquo; she cried in
warning. &ldquo;Go no farther, I beg of you!
Yonder is certain destruction for us
both! It is the Pit of Fumes! Those
dread and yellow mists carry poison in
their breath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though that be so, yet I must conquer
them, for behind us lies your
prison,&rdquo; the Prince replied to her. &ldquo;To
it we must not return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never shall you risk such danger for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>my sake,&rdquo; the Shadow Witch answered
firmly. &ldquo;Better an endless prison for
me than such dreadful peril for you. I
speak of what I know&mdash;none but my
brother has ever dared to enter yonder
place. You shall not go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when this place is passed,&rdquo; demanded
the Prince, &ldquo;what lies beyond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What matters it what lies beyond,
when destruction lies between?&rdquo; she
murmured sadly. &ldquo;Were the way ever so
open when the Pit is passed, it is closed
to us who stand upon this side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What lies beyond?&rdquo; demanded he
again. &ldquo;Answer me truly, for I must
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Shadow Witch knew that she
must tell him. She covered her face with
her hands, and her tears fell fast. For
a moment she could not speak.</p>

<p>Prince Ember dried her tears with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>tender hand. &ldquo;What lies beyond?&rdquo; he
insisted gently.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch clung to him desperately.
&ldquo;The way to the Cave Hall,&rdquo;
she admitted. &ldquo;But, oh, I cannot let you
venture where the Pit lies. No, no!
Many times have I heard my brother
boast to his neighbors that none but himself
can draw nigh to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, dear Shadow Witch,&rdquo; said the
Prince consolingly, &ldquo;yonder is a place
of terror, in very truth, yet we shall pass
it safely, in spite of that. There is good
magic which can put to naught even this
evil Pit of your brother&#8217;s. Look&mdash;I will
show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into his breast, and
took out a small round box which was
hidden there. &ldquo;This is the gift of him
who is oldest and wisest in all the Kingdom
of the Fire,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>he gave it, he assured me that when the
dangers of the way were greatest, when
the way itself seemed closed beyond all
hope, that this which my box contains
will conquer the danger and make the
road to safety plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Opening the box he took out the piece
of charcoal that lay within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay you here,&rdquo; he bade her, &ldquo;until I
have prepared the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she was not willing that he should
go without her. &ldquo;Whatever comes, we
meet it side by side,&rdquo; she declared.</p>

<p>Nothing that he could say would persuade
her to do otherwise, and so at last
he consented, but as they drew nearer to
the Pit, the noisome odor of its fumes
swept toward her and overcame her.
Her face grew pale, and she began to
sink to the ground.</p>

<p>The Prince knew, that in spite of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>courage, she could endure no more. He
led her back a little way, and forced her
gently to rest upon a jutting of the wall.
There he left her, weak and trembling, to
await his return.</p>

<p>Stronger arose the breath of the Pit,
and yet more deadly grew its fumes as
the Prince drew near it, but he was undismayed.
Straight toward the yellow
mists he went, and in his hand was the
gift of the Wise One. Presently, he
reached that point where he himself
dared go no farther. The choking vapors
floated round him, but the Pit itself,
yawning wide and terrible, was still
some distance from where he stood.
Now he must trust to the strength of his
arm, to the sureness of his aim. He drew
himself to his full height; he threw back
his arm, and hurled the magic charcoal
straight to its mark. &ldquo;Descend into this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>Pit!&rdquo; he cried, as it left his hand. &ldquo;Descend,
and make this evil place to exhale
no more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like an arrow it sped. Into the very
heart of the Pit it fell, and then were the
Wise One&#8217;s words fulfilled. Like surly
slaves, obeying unwillingly, the yellow
mists sank back into the Pit, lower and
lower, till they were seen no more, and
with them went their noisome breath,
leaving the air pure and clean. As they
vanished, the way which led out of this
hollow chamber to the corridor beyond
lay plainly visible along the very edge
of the Pit.</p>

<p>Prince Ember was about to go and
fetch the Shadow Witch from where he
had left her, but he had no need. She
had felt her strength come flooding back
to her when the mists departed, and immediately
she rose and came to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>&ldquo;Why should I ever fear, when you
are with me?&rdquo; she whispered to him.
&ldquo;How can I ever fail to trust your power
to conquer and to save?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away from the now vanquished Pit
of Fumes they hurried, along a corridor
as dusky and deserted as the first had
been. Before they had gone far upon it,
they heard the low murmuring of voices,
and soon they found themselves at the
entrance to a low and vaulted chamber,
dark like all the rest, but set about with
dim lanterns and peopled with many
Imps, busy at strange tasks.</p>

<p>Some stood before dingy looms,
weaving huge curtains of soot, to replace
those which covered the walls in
the Cave Hall, when they should become
worn, and drop to pieces. Others sat
upon blocks of charcoal and braided
ropes of darkness to bind those who disobeyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>the Wizard&#8217;s will and though
they knew that they themselves might at
any time be bound by them, they durst
not make them less strong than their
master ordained that they should be.</p>

<p>Over them stood the Chief Imp, whose
business it was to see that none failed in
his duty, or gossiped unduly with his
neighbors, and so deeply engaged in
their several tasks were one and all, that
none heard the sound of approaching
footsteps, none knew that any but themselves
were near, till quite by accident
the Chief Imp raised his head and saw
within the doorway of the chamber the
ruddy form of Prince Ember standing,
and by his side the grey Shadow Witch,
whom all had believed to be closely
guarded by the walls of her distant
prison.</p>

<p>Before the Chief Imp could give a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>command, before any other could cry
out, or attempt evil, the Prince had
drawn forth a wand from beneath his
mantle and raised it. Clear and strong
his voice fell on their ears, saying, &ldquo;Stir
not from your places, nor speak, until
the hour when the feet of the Shadow
Witch stand once more within the safe
borders of her own land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under Prince Ember&#8217;s spell each servant
of the Wizard became fixed in his
place, unable to move or to utter a syllable.
With staring eyes they beheld the
Prince and his companion advance, and
pass through their very midst, whilst
they remained powerless to so much as
stretch out a hand to clutch at their garments.</p>

<p>In their rebellious ears the words of
his enchantment were still ringing as he
departed with the Shadow Witch from
their sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">P</span>rince Ember</span> and the Shadow
Witch were now rapidly approaching
the Cave Hall. On their way they
passed other vaulted chambers, like the
one they had just left, and glancing into
these as they hastened by, they saw great
urns with ponderous lids, and enormous
chests, all marked with the signs of the
Wizard, filled, as the Shadow Witch was
well aware, with those evil things with
which he worked his spells, but not an
Imp was anywhere to be seen.</p>

<p>She glided cautiously to the door of
one of these rooms and peeped in. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>found, as she had supposed, that it was
the bedchamber of her brother. His
huge bed, with its jet black coverings
and pillows stood ready to receive him;
his tall chair was set close beside it. Near
by was his special treasure chest, in
which his choicest wands and spellbooks
were locked carefully away from
prying fingers, but this room was as silent
and deserted as all the rest.</p>

<p>On a sudden they heard loud rapping,
which became still louder, and then a
harsh voice crying out in angry tones,
again and yet again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my brother calling for his
Imps,&rdquo; whispered the Shadow Witch.
&ldquo;He is not used to have them tarry
when he summons them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as she said: the Wizard, in the
Cave Hall, was grey with rage. Never
before had he called to his servants without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>their scurrying on nimble feet to
learn his desires, but this time he had
struck repeatedly upon the arm of his
chair, and had lifted his voice louder and
louder, yet neither the Chief Imp nor any
other came. He knew where and how
they should be employed at this time, and
if they were doing their duty, they were
within sound of his voice. How they
could dare not to answer him, how they
could be deaf when he summoned them,
the Wizard could not understand.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch stole closer to
Prince Ember, and spoke beneath her
breath. &ldquo;The Wizard is but a few yards
from us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A moment more,
and we must encounter him. I do not
fear him now, for in this part of the Cave
my power has always been fully equal
to his own. The truth is, I have more
than once defeated him here. He remembers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>it well. Yet&mdash;I was long bound by
that dark prison&mdash;long subject to his
power. Before I return to the Land of
Shadows, I must test myself, for I wish
to be certain that I can still meet and defy
him in his Cave Hall without being conquered
by him; but in order to make sure
of myself I must go before him quite
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Ember shook his head. &ldquo;I
would not have you venture it,&rdquo; he objected.
&ldquo;The risk is too great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not when you are near me,&rdquo; she told
him confidently. &ldquo;If the moment should
come when I know that I am unable to
resist him longer, I will call to you, and
you will hasten to my help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reluctantly the Prince consented, and
she glided away from him with soundless
footsteps. Close, close behind her he
followed till they reached the threshold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>of the Cave Hall. There he tarried out
of sight, yet where his eyes could still
keep guard over her.</p>

<p>The Wizard, provoked beyond measure
by the inattention of his servants,
was about to rise from his chair to go and
learn the reason, and to punish them,
when suddenly a low-toned laugh struck
on his ears. It startled him, for it was the
familiar laughter of his sister&mdash;his sister,
whom he believed to be far away, hopelessly
imprisoned in the deepest recesses
of his cavern. He turned his head in the
direction from whence it came, and as
he half rose from his seat, puzzled and
uncertain, it echoed a second time
through the Cave. It came from close
by, in that dusky corridor that led to his
own bedchamber, led to the rooms beyond
where the Imps were busy, ay&mdash;and
led on still further to his Pit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>Fumes. By that way his sister could
not pass. He smiled cruelly as he
thought of that inconquerable barrier to
her coming. By the other way there was
the double wall, sealed by his enchantment.
Remembering these things he
was certain that he but imagined that he
had heard her echoing laugh.</p>

<p>Even as he said this, he heard it again,
and stealing toward him from out the
corridor came a grey figure, laughing
as she came. He gazed at it in wonder.
It could not really be the Shadow Witch,
he told himself. It must be that his eyes
were deceiving him.</p>

<p>Impossible as it seemed, however, he
presently saw that it was she who stood
before him, knew that it was her own
voice that rang clear and triumphant in
his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dungeon in which you thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>to hold me was not strong enough when
that day came of which I warned you,
brother,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;By a power
stronger than yours I have escaped, and
I am here in proof that you have failed.
In this place, as you well know, you can
do naught against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wizard&#8217;s eyes flashed fire. He
made a step forward with hands outstretched
to seize her. &ldquo;Do not boast too
soon,&rdquo; retorted he. &ldquo;I have yet a
spell to conquer you even here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although the Shadow Witch held her
head high in defiance of him, she retreated
a few paces. It was true, as she
had said, that she was not afraid, but she
did not mean to be without caution. She
would make her test quickly. If she
could but baffle him once more with that
old trick of hers, that thus far had never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>failed to confound him, she would know
that she was safe against him.</p>

<p>She waved her grey sleeves, and instantly
there fell between her and the
Wizard her magic curtain, her moving
curtain of shadow. Before it stood a
shadow image, so like to herself that it
deceived even the keen eyes of the Wizard.
Behind the curtain she herself was
perfectly concealed.</p>

<p>It was done so quickly, so skilfully,
that the Wizard did not guess what had
happened. He snatched at the image but
when he had almost grasped it, it withdrew
from him swiftly. When he pursued
it, it darted now to this side, now to
that, with marvelous agility, always
seeming just within reach of his fingers,
yet always just eluding them as they began
to close upon it, and each time he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>failed he heard the laughter that so
mocked him.</p>

<p>A triumphant smile stole over the face
of the Shadow Witch, for she saw plainly
that she was still able to defend herself
against him. Knowing how easily she
could escape now from the Cave Hall
with Prince Ember, she was about to
beckon to him, but she was too late, for
in that moment the Wizard snatched
more swiftly than he had yet done at the
gliding figure before the curtain, and
this time not in vain. His hands closed
upon it, indeed, but closed on nothingness,
and thus he learned that he had
once more been cheated by his sister&#8217;s
art.</p>

<p>Filled with wrath, he shouted words of
enchantment, in a voice loud and compelling,
and in answer to them dense
darkness descended swiftly over all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>Cave Hall, making it as black as the
prison from whence the Shadow Witch
had escaped. That which she had not
believed that he could do here, he had
done. Before the darkness her shadow
curtain dissolved, and she herself, crying
aloud, sank down helpless to the Cave
floor.</p>

<p>Now at last the Wizard was certain
that she was utterly in his power, was certain
that there was none near to hear or
answer the sharp cry for help which she
had given when she fell. He bent down
through the gloom to seize her, but as he
did so, the darkness broke and fled, and
in its place a rich warm light came flooding
through the Cave Hall. It shone
upon the evil face of the Wizard stooping
there; it made plain the form of the
Shadow Witch where she lay.</p>

<p>Startled by this strange light, the Wizard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>threw back his head to discover from
whence it came, and beheld in the doorway
the figure of Prince Ember, standing
with the Sword of Fire upraised.</p>

<p>It was from the Sword that this ruddy
glow streamed forth, and as the Prince
advanced rapidly into the Cave Hall, the
light grew more intense, so that the Wizard
could not bear to look upon its
beauty, nor could he bear the strong pure
heat that flowed from the Sword as it
drew nearer and more near.</p>

<p>Anguish seized him, and a weakness
greater even than he had felt before the
Sword of Flames in the hands of Prince
Radiance. He gave a hoarse cry to his
servants for help, but they, voiceless and
motionless prisoners in their vaulted
chamber, could not answer, could not
come to him, although they heard him
call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>He tried to struggle to his feet, but it
was quite in vain. Instead he fell prone
upon the ground. As he lay there, he
saw his sister rise from where his evil
spell had cast her, saw her grow strong
again, saw joy and courage beam in her
face. Her eyes were lifted to this
stranger, come to succor her with the
glowing light and warmth of his conquering
Sword. By all these things he
knew that the Prince, of whom Black
Shadow had warned him, had come at
last.</p>

<p>Prince Ember stretched above his
prostrate form the fiery Sword. &ldquo;Cruel
and wicked master of the Cave,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;here shall you lie in bondage to
this Sword until the hour when your
sister stands safely within her own borders.
Cry not to your servants yonder.
They, too, are bound by my spell and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>cannot answer. Cry not to your guardians
of the Cave Mouth. They also shall
be enchained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deep into the frame of the Wizard the
magic of the Sword pierced its way. He
saw, as in a vision, the Prince put back
his Sword. With dulling eyes, he beheld
his sister take the hand which the
stranger tenderly extended to her. He
perceived them go together from the
Cave Hall, and into that corridor that
led to freedom.</p>

<p>Then all sense and thought forsook
him. The spell of the Sword of Fire had
so penetrated his inmost being that he no
longer was aware that beyond the Cave
lurked Curling Smoke and the Ash Goblin,
and that farther away the Wind in
the Chimney waited, all pledged to destroy
Prince Ember, and to prevent the
escape of the Shadow Witch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>Meanwhile the two pursued their way
to the Cave&#8217;s mouth. At its entrance
those Imps who had been sent to guard it
still kept vigilant watch. None had ventured
to sleep or to stir from his post,
for though the time had been long, and
no one had tried to pass them, they dared
not be unfaithful to their trust. They
feared the Wizard&#8217;s wrath and the punishment
that would surely befall them, if
anything should go amiss through fault
of theirs.</p>

<p>But as Prince Ember and the Shadow
Witch approached them, a strange and
unfamiliar warmth stole over the watchers,
benumbing all their senses. Drowsiness
came down upon them where they
stood or sat, and with one accord they
began to nod, to sink off to sleep, and
presently they were wrapped in a slumber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>so profound that nothing could possibly
break it.</p>

<p>This, too, was the spell of the Sword of
Fire.</p>

<p>As the Shadow Witch passed the Imps
and saw them sleeping there, some leaning
upright against the rough wall of the
cavern, some with heads bowed on
knees, and others lying prostrate on the
ground, she turned her head to her companion,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vain are my brother&#8217;s guards,&rdquo; she
murmured, &ldquo;when Prince Ember
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ejoicing</span> in the freedom which
she now felt was fully restored to
her, the Shadow Witch glided from the
Cave of Darkness and was about to descend
the cliff, but Prince Ember laid a
gentle hand upon her, to draw her back.
&ldquo;Dear Lady of the Shadows,&rdquo; he said in
an undertone, &ldquo;we must not go unprotected
into the open. It may be that unseen
enemies are lurking there, who at
least have power to hinder us, even if
they cannot harm us. I have in my possession
a magic Cloak, which will make
us invisible to our enemies, and enable
us to go securely and swiftly on our way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>Let us put it on.&rdquo; So saying, he drew
her still closer to him, and took from his
belt the Cloak of Ash and cast it about
them both.</p>

<p>She thanked him sweetly for his constant
care of her, and side by side they
went down the cliff.</p>

<p>But though they were now unseen,
they had stood for a moment before the
Cave entrance, fully revealed, and in
that moment the eyes of an enemy had
caught sight of them.</p>

<p>Long had Curling Smoke crouched
low in his cranny in the cliff-side. His
gaze had roved unceasingly over the
Plain of Ash. So vigilant was he that he
was sure that none could possibly have
approached the Wizard&#8217;s Cave without
being seen by him from his hiding-place.
Nevertheless, hour had dragged slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>after hour, and still the one for whom he
waited did not appear.</p>

<p>The giant&#8217;s eyeballs ached, and grew
dim at length from his steadfast watching.
Had it not been for his keen desire
to satisfy his own ancient grudge against
the good fairies of the Fire, he would
have broken his promise to the Wizard,
and careless as to whether or not the
Prince went by, he would have lain
down to rest.</p>

<p>He wondered greatly at the delay, for,
long since, Black Shadow had told him
that the stranger was already within the
Elf&#8217;s dwelling in the Borderland. If this
were true, he should have reached the
Cave by now. Curling Smoke could not
imagine what this important matter
could be which could detain the Prince
so long, yet in spite of his weariness, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>continued to look away in the direction
of the Elf&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Growing more and more restless and
impatient, he finally rose a little in his
place of concealment and thrust out his
head far enough to see not only the expanse
of the Plain and the path up the
cliff-side, but the entrance to the Cave of
Darkness as well. What was his astonishment
to see two figures standing before
it&mdash;one of them the grey-robed Shadow
Witch, whom he knew well, the other a
stranger, and clad in those ruddy garments
by which Black Shadow had declared
he might recognize Prince Ember.
He could scarcely believe it to be
possible that the Shadow Witch had escaped
from her brother&mdash;that the Prince
had crossed the Plain under his very eyes
unseen. Yet there they were, almost in
his grasp. Eager to snatch at them both,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>he was about to emerge from his hiding-place,
when, to his discomfiture, they
both vanished suddenly from his sight.</p>

<p>That they had gone back into the cavern
he did not believe to be possible.
Moreover their faces had been set toward
the Plain. There could be no
doubt that they had made themselves invisible,
and were now on their way down
the cliff.</p>

<p>Unseen though they were, he knew
how he could entrap them, and hold
them in his power. Determined to do
this, he wound his form stealthily upward,
and from his right hand he cast
forth huge plumes and columns of
smoke, which began to overspread the
sky, and traveling swiftly, came on and
on as his hand directed them, until they
hung poised far above the heads of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>unsuspecting Prince and his companion.</p>

<p>From his left hand long wreaths and
streamers of smoke went out across the
ground, creeping along fast and silently,
veiling it so that none could see where
his own feet trod.</p>

<p>Closer and closer from behind these,
great smoke walls drew in, but the faces
of the two were set steadily toward the
Land of Shadows, and they knew naught
of the danger which was so rapidly overtaking
them.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, by the enchanter&#8217;s
power, a smoke wall, dense and impenetrable,
fell from above directly before the
travelers, setting a barrier between them
and the land to which they were bound.
All at once they found themselves in a
vast chamber, hemmed in on every hand
by the encompassing smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>The Shadow Witch was first to
awaken to their peril. Casting her eyes
downward by chance, she all at once became
aware of a faint veil of smoke that
was creeping round about her feet.
Well did she know by that sign who was
near. She cast her eyes hurriedly on all
sides, and saw with alarm that the smoke
was drawing in upon them from every
quarter.</p>

<p>She caught Prince Ember&#8217;s arm, whispering
anxiously, &ldquo;Behold, my Prince,
behold the smoke fog! This is the work
of the powerful magician, Curling
Smoke. We are entrapped.&rdquo; At that
same moment the smoke dropped down
in front of them, making complete the
walls of the vast chamber in which they
stood imprisoned.</p>

<p>Prince Ember, beholding, was motionless
with dismay. Flashing back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>his mind came the warning of his good
friend the Elf. &ldquo;Beware of Curling
Smoke,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;None more
wicked and dreadful than he inhabits the
lands through which you must pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How or when the giant had discovered
the presence of himself and the Shadow
Witch, the Prince could not guess, unless
it had been in that one unguarded
moment before the Cave, but now he was
upon them with his enchantments, and
he might be able to overpower them
both, armed though they were with the
Cloak of Ash and the Sword of Fire. In
spite of his great courage, Prince Ember&#8217;s
heart sank low in his breast before
this fresh danger to his beloved Shadow
Witch. Thinking intently of how best
to act against this new foe, he stood
silent.</p>

<p>Again the Shadow Witch whispered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>low: &ldquo;See! Yonder from out the fog he
comes, with his veils trailing from his
arm&mdash;the Veil that Chokes&mdash;the Veil
that Blinds! He has discovered us, and
means to destroy us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Ember cast his arm about her
and pressed her dear head protectingly
to his breast. Spurred on by his love for
her his courage mounted high. Looking
to where she directed his gaze, he,
too, saw, looming out of the murky
clouds, a great shape, fierce and terrible&mdash;the
giant, Curling Smoke.</p>

<p>From his huge arms hung the veils of
which the Shadow Witch had spoken,
held always ready to use against any
who provoked his wrath. He stood still,
at some distance from them, and
searched the dim spaces about him with
piercing eyes, but seemed not to find the
ones he sought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>&ldquo;He does not see us, dearest,&rdquo; spoke
the Prince, under his breath. &ldquo;The
Cloak conceals us, as the Elf promised
that it would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered the Shadow Witch,
&ldquo;but before we escape this giant we must
do battle with him. I know well his
ways, and I doubt not that he has joined
himself to my brother for our destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a weapon which has not yet
failed me,&rdquo; the Prince assured her
bravely. &ldquo;With it I will meet him, and
by using it valiantly shall hope to overcome
him and deliver you.&rdquo; He was
about to draw the Sword of Fire, but the
Shadow Witch prevented him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, not yet,&rdquo; she besought him.
&ldquo;Fully do I trust the marvelous power of
your Sword, and it will be potent here,
I doubt not, if the moment of its using be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>right, but I have heard that Curling
Smoke cannot be vanquished in his
smoke chamber until he towers within
it to his fullest height. This I believe I
have the power to make him do, and
when he has done so, I am sure you
will not strike in vain. Till then let your
Sword rest quiet in its sheath, but keep
your hand upon its hilt, and when I give
the word, draw it at once and strike
quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you say,&rdquo; the Prince
promised her, looking into her uplifted
face with tender love.</p>

<p>While they had said these things, Curling
Smoke had remained where he was,
waiting, as if in the hope that he might
make visible, by his mere gazing, those
whom he had entrapped. Presently they
heard his voice crying aloud through the
fog, &ldquo;Let those beware who defy Curling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Smoke. Though they be invisible,
they shall yet feel his power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beneath the Cloak of Ash, the Shadow
Witch raised her grey sleeves and waved
them toward Curling Smoke. Prince
Ember, watching to see what she was
about to do, saw a creature, as if in answer
to the giant&#8217;s cry, take shape from
among the smoke wreaths that lay along
the ground and begin to creep, half hidden
by them, toward the giant.</p>

<p>Curling Smoke suddenly beheld it
also, beheld it with curiosity and astonishment,
for this was neither the Prince
nor the Shadow Witch, both of whom he
believed to be bound by his enchantment,
but a stranger. How he had entered the
smoke chamber, he did not know. Remaining,
poised watchfully where he
was, he kept his glittering eyes upon it,
till it should draw nearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>Before it reached him it began to rise,
to grow larger as it rose, and he presently
saw that it was a giant like himself,
though smaller and less terrible. His
head was bent and his face hidden.</p>

<p>Curling Smoke gazed upon the newcomer
with indignation. &ldquo;Who are you,
who dare to venture unasked within
the bounds that I have set?&rdquo; he demanded
imperiously.</p>

<p>The stranger made no answer, but
ceasing to mount, stood poised directly
in front of him, with his face still concealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know you not that I am the Master
Magician and have power to destroy you
instantly?&rdquo; shouted Curling Smoke, lifting
his huge hand in menace.</p>

<p>Still the creature did not reply.</p>

<p>Instantly Curling Smoke unloosed his
terrible Veil that Chokes, and flung it at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>him. It smote against the drooped head
of the unknown, but instead of suffocating
him, as Curling Smoke had intended
that it should, it floated harmlessly
back again and hung itself about
the enchanter&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>Foiled though he had been in his first
attempt, Curling Smoke was not discomfited.
He shook free his Veil that
Blinds. &ldquo;This&mdash;this shall overcome
you,&rdquo; he cried boastfully. &ldquo;Now shall
you learn how great is the power of the
Magician of Veils.&rdquo; With skilful hands
he so wielded it, that it struck full in the
eyes of the intruder, even though his
head was still bent low. Yet in spite of
this, the second veil drifted back defeated
to its place beside the Veil that
Chokes.</p>

<p>Wrathful and puzzled because his
veils had proved themselves thus powerless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>against this silent and seemingly
defenceless stranger, Curling Smoke
thrust out his powerful arms to wind his
adversary round and crush him, but the
stranger melted from his coils, and stood
beyond his grasp unharmed as before.</p>

<p>Then he began again to mount. He
reached the magician&#8217;s shoulders, and
shooting yet higher threw back his head.</p>

<p>Curling Smoke, looking upon him,
saw to his amazement the face of Prince
Ember; a giant now in size, and grey-robed,
but still Prince Ember. What
had become of the Shadow Witch, by
what magic the Prince had become thus
transformed, the magician could not
guess, nor did he care, provided he but
succeeded in conquering this hated visitant
from the Land of Fire.</p>

<p>He regarded him in silence for a moment,
pondering how he should accomplish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>it. Here was his match in size;
here was one against whom his veils
were powerless; here, too, was a creature
who melted from his grasp when he
thought to seize and twist him. What,
then, remained for him to do? This
only: to overtop him and smother him
by casting himself down upon him from
above.</p>

<p>Immediately he began to send himself
upward in rapidly rising spirals, so that
he might throw himself down upon the
stranger with the greater force, but as
he mounted, the other ascended also,
faster and faster, higher and higher, always
head and shoulders above Curling
Smoke.</p>

<p>As Curling Smoke rose, he shouted
threats and defiance, shaking his fist at
his rival and glaring up at him with malicious
and baneful eyes. But the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>still maintained his strange silence and
met his look unmoved.</p>

<p>Prince Ember watching this phantom
of himself from the shelter of the Cloak
of Ash, marvelled at the power of the
Shadow Witch who, by her magic, could
so delude their foe. As he watched, he
held himself in readiness to draw his
sword when his companion gave the
word.</p>

<p>Still higher towered the phantom
Prince, and after him sprang Curling
Smoke, wreathing his murky spirals upward,
and crying out more and more
boisterously as he grew the more enraged
by every vain effort to reach and overleap
him.</p>

<p>The two had almost reached the dome,
and Prince Ember&#8217;s hand tightened
on his Sword, for he felt that the time to
use it was near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>&ldquo;Not yet, my Prince,&rdquo; whispered the
Shadow Witch. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An arm&#8217;s length higher she sent her
phantom, and made him pause. Seeing
this, sure now that his enemy could go
no further, Curling Smoke shot up with
lightning swiftness and stood above him
at last, stretched to his full height, an immensely
tall and straight and slender column,
poised on tiptoe to spring and overleap
him. His voice rang out hoarsely.
&ldquo;Ah, now you shall not escape me! At
last your time has come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; breathed the Shadow Witch
to the waiting Prince. &ldquo;Strike now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swiftly Prince Ember threw back the
Cloak of Ash. The Sword of Fire
glowed red as it swung through the air,
and redder still as it struck the limbs of
Curling Smoke and clove them. As the
strange heat of that fairy Sword rushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>through his giant frame, Curling Smoke
became as naught. His limbs were
seized with faintness and trembling.
The phantom Prince vanished suddenly
from before him, and his own Veil that
Blinds rose in darkening folds across his
eyes. The Veil that Chokes swept across
his mouth, and his turbulent voice was
stilled. He began to shrink upward, to
waver and fade, and presently he drifted
helplessly into the great smoke dome and
was swallowed up in it.</p>

<p>Then, also, before the mighty heat that
flowed from the Sword of Fire, the walls
and dome of the vast smoke chamber,
and the smoke wreaths upon the ground,
were themselves dissolved, and Prince
Ember and the Shadow Witch stood free
in the Plain of Ash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my brave Prince! By your
Sword of Fire, how gloriously you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>conquered!&rdquo; exclaimed the Shadow
Witch, with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget not the magic of my dear
Lady of the Shadows,&rdquo; Prince Ember
tenderly reminded her, &ldquo;for without its
aid this victory could scarcely have been
won.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch laughed sweetly.
&ldquo;On, on together, then,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith</span> the perils of the Cave of
Darkness left behind, with Curling
Smoke vanquished and driven far
off, the Shadow Witch was happy; and
in her presence Prince Ember gave no
thought for the moment to any further
danger that might beset them.</p>

<p>Danger was not far distant. In the
spot that he had chosen, the Ash Goblin
worked fast and diligently upon the
snare with which he meant to entrap
Prince Ember, hoping that he might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>able to complete it before the Prince arrived.</p>

<p>He could plainly see the Elf&#8217;s house
from where he labored. He believed
the Prince to be still within its walls, and
he was sure that none as yet had crossed
its threshold. With his twisted hands he
took from the long bag hidden beneath
his cloak the evil ash, of which alone his
snare could be made, and sifted it carefully
over the ground. Meanwhile he
repeated the words of enchantment written
in his Book of Craft, which he believed
would make certain the capture of
Prince Ember, but he took good care to
repeat them silently, lest any, coming
upon him unawares, should overhear
them and learn his secret. As the ash
fell to the ground from his fingers, it
spread and ran together to form a thin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>and web-like film, leaving no spot uncovered.</p>

<p>So treacherous was this snare, that if
one but stepped upon its borders, he
would become unable to release his feet
from it and would be drawn helplessly
to its centre. There the web would rise
upon him from all sides with lightning
swiftness to enmesh him and draw him
down till he was fast bound in its folds,
and there he must perish in his vain
efforts to escape. This was the trap that
the Ash Goblin was cunningly and
silently preparing for Prince Ember,
keeping watch in the meanwhile for him
to approach. He kept himself close to
the ground, concealed by the ashes
around him, so like they were in color to
his dingy robe, and the cap that covered
his matted grizzled hair. Occasionally
he chuckled to himself at the thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>the discomfiture which lay in store for
Curling Smoke, that boastful giant,
whom he believed to be lying in wait for
the Prince near to the Wizard&#8217;s Cave.
Such confidence had the Ash Goblin in
his snare that never for an instant did he
believe that the Prince could escape it
and come within reach of the giant&#8217;s
arms.</p>

<p>While he worked and exulted thus, he
did not forget that in conquering Prince
Ember, he would pay off, also, his old
grudge against the Shadow Witch for
her mockery of him.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch, coming across
the Plain of Ash with the Prince, safe-sheltered
by the Cloak of the good Elf,
had been sure that they were now safe
from peril, when on a sudden it seemed
as if a warning hand were laid upon her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>She stopped and looked around her, but
saw nothing.</p>

<p>Then, with piercing eyes, she scanned
the Plain in front. At a considerable
distance from her, bent over the ash, she
espied a figure well-known to her&mdash;the
Ash Goblin, intent upon some task. She
suspected danger, and caught at the
Prince&#8217;s mantle, exclaiming beneath her
breath, &ldquo;The Ash Goblin! See, how
stealthily he creeps along! Never does
he venture so far from home unless he
has evil plans afoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Ember had forgotten the Ash
Goblin, had forgotten the words of the
Elf of the Borderland, but now they returned
to him. &ldquo;Beware of the Ash
Goblin! He is small of stature, but he
cannot safely be despised, for he is very
cunning.&rdquo; He followed the pointing
finger of the Shadow Witch, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>might behold this new enemy, but he
strained his eyes in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see nothing but the grey Plain that
lies between us and the Elf&#8217;s dwelling,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>

<p>She laid her hand lightly upon his eyes
for a moment, and by the magic of her
touch made his vision more keen. &ldquo;Look
now,&rdquo; she urged, withdrawing her hand,
&ldquo;and you will see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Ember obeyed, and immediately
he, too, beheld the ugly form of
the Ash Goblin bending over his snare.
&ldquo;Yes, there he is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I remember
now how earnestly the Elf of the
Borderland bade me be on my guard
against his cunning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my Prince,&rdquo; the Shadow Witch
responded, &ldquo;you may well be on your
guard. Though he knows the weakness
of his body too well to dare to attack an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>enemy in fair and open fight, he is
powerful in such craft as he can carry
out in secret. Whether or not he is preparing
a trap for us, I cannot tell. One
thing is certain, we cannot choose but
pass over the place where he is at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever may lie in wait for us
there, my dear Shadow Witch,&rdquo; Prince
Ember assured her, &ldquo;we will meet it unafraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went directly toward their foe.
Nowhere did they see anything that
spoke of danger until they were but a
stone&#8217;s throw from where the Ash Goblin
knelt. There they stood still to scan
his work, and beheld a delicate mesh, so
thin and fine that it was well-nigh invisible,
stretching away to right and left of
him and in front of him.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch, seeing, shrank
back aghast. &ldquo;It is the cunning web of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>the Ash Goblin!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;None
escapes destruction who sets foot within
its bounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the Prince could answer, the
Ash Goblin rose. He had put the final
touch to his work. The last handful of
his ash had been strewn, the last word of
his spell had been pronounced, and
weary with long bending over his work,
he drew himself up slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A goodly snare, a goodly snare,&rdquo;
they heard him mutter to himself.
&ldquo;Never yet has it failed me&mdash;no, nor ever
shall, so long as I hold the secret of my
evil ash, so long as I remember the words
of my ancient spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gloated over it for a moment in
silence, and then continued: &ldquo;To this
snare the feet of Prince Ember must
come. When he treads so much as its
border he is lost, and when he is lost, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>impudent Shadow Witch in her dungeon
may await her brother&#8217;s pleasure for her
deliverance. Let her learn in good time,
that it is the Ash Goblin, the Ash Goblin
whom she has so often mocked, who
has helped to keep her there.&rdquo; He
wagged his head exultantly, and sank
down again to conceal himself in the
ashes, and there await unseen the coming
of the Prince.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch heard his words,
and her cheek grew pale as ivory. She
pressed her hands close together and
looked into Prince Ember&#8217;s face, her
eyes full of pain. &ldquo;Alas! my Prince,&rdquo;
she whispered, &ldquo;it grieves me that you
should encounter so many perils for my
sake! And here&mdash;ah, here, I am afraid
that all your wondrous fairy power cannot
suffice to break this wicked snare
that has been set for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>Prince Ember smiled. &ldquo;Grieve not
so, my Shadow Witch,&rdquo; he consoled her.
&ldquo;There is no danger that I would not
meet gladly for your sake. Think not
that I cannot here match magic with
magic, and conquer, for there is no evil
enchantment but must yield before the
power of the good fairies of the Fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With quiet confidence he left the shelter
of the Cloak of Ash, and in his hand
was his fairy sword. It shone with a red
glory.</p>

<p>The Ash Goblin, crouching upon the
ground, keeping his eyes fixed upon the
Elf&#8217;s threshold, had heard no syllable
that had been spoken, nor knew that anyone
was near.</p>

<p>But now his staring eyes suddenly beheld
the place about him suffused with
scarlet light. He leapt to his feet, turning
in swift amaze to learn from whence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>it came, and saw Prince Ember standing,
with Sword extended like a bar of
fire across his snare. From it streamed
that heat, potent and overmastering,
wherein its magic dwelt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the snare of the Ash Goblin perish
before the power of the Sword of
Fire!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince, and as he
uttered the words the Ash Goblin saw
the web that he had been at such pains to
prepare, begin to shrivel and shrink
away, and presently it had vanished
completely from the surface of the
Plain.</p>

<p>A frenzied shriek burst from the Ash
Goblin at the sight of his work destroyed
before his very eyes and by the one for
whom the snare had been laid. Coward
though he was, he would have rushed
upon the Prince to attack him with all
his puny strength, had not the heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>which streamed from the Sword of Fire
made his limbs powerless to stir from the
spot where he lay hid, had not the glow
which surrounded him become so intense
that he was forced to bury his head
in his cloak, lest his eyes should be
blinded by it.</p>

<p>Crouching there, wrapped to the very
crown of his head in his dingy cloak, he
heard again the voice of Prince Ember.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depart quickly,&rdquo; commanded the
Prince, &ldquo;lest you be consumed in like
manner as your evil snare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Ash Goblin rose and fled
away in terror from the place where he
had hoped to triumph, fled on and on,
until he came to the threshold of his own
hut. In desperate haste he undid the
door, and rushing in, closed and barred
it fast, to shut out the spell of the conquering
Sword.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile</span> Prince Ember had passed
from place to place, everywhere
meeting and conquering the perils that
beset him and his companion, the Wind
in the Chimney had not been unmindful
of his promise to Black Shadow. On the
contrary, he was only too willing to help
the Wizard.</p>

<p>As soon as the Wizard&#8217;s messenger
had departed from him, he despatched a
half dozen of his keenest and most agile
Breezes to the Chimney Mouth to spy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>upon the Elf&#8217;s house from thence, and
bring him word at once the moment the
Prince was seen to cross its threshold.</p>

<p>During the time, therefore, that the
Imps had been keeping guard at the entrance
to the Wizard&#8217;s cavern, the
Breezes, on their part, had been industriously
looking across the Plain from
the Chimney Mouth, but with no better
fortune in the one case than in the other.</p>

<p>Once, it is true, they, like the Ash
Goblin, had espied the Elf&#8217;s door open
slowly and remain so for a moment, and
they had waited eagerly for the Prince to
come forth, but no one had appeared,
and presently the door had closed again
and had remained fast shut ever since.</p>

<p>The Wind, sitting on his rough seat
in the Chimney, began to chafe at the
delay. He did not overlook the fact that
the Breezes were merry fellows, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>that, though they took no liberties while
they were under his eye, and talked only
in whispers among themselves when
they perched in the Chimney nooks, they
had only to be out of his sight to begin to
whisk gaily about and dance and sing in
the liveliest possible manner, so as to enjoy
their freedom to the utmost.</p>

<p>He began to believe that even on this
occasion, in spite of the strictness of his
commands, they were amusing themselves
after their usual fashion, and, becoming
more and more careless and inattentive
to their duty, had allowed
Prince Ember to go on his way unobserved.</p>

<p>Leaning forward in his seat, he called
down to them gruffly, demanding to
know whether any sign had yet been seen
of the stranger prince. When he received
their answer, he was more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>ever convinced of their negligence and
gave orders that one of their number
should go out and scour the Plain, to discover
whether the Prince was anywhere
about. But the one who had been sent
returned to say that there was nothing to
be seen but the yellow fog of Curling
Smoke.</p>

<p>The Wind shrugged his great shoulders
contemptuously. &ldquo;The affairs of
Curling Smoke do not interest me,&rdquo; he
declared.</p>

<p>For a little longer he waited and then
began to stir about impatiently upon his
Chimney seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go out and search the Plain more
carefully than was done by your fellow,&rdquo;
he shouted to another of the Breezes. &ldquo;It
is quite impossible that the Prince should
still be in the Elf&#8217;s house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swift to obey his master, the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>Breeze went forth, yet came back in a
little while, declaring that he had seen no
one but the Ash Goblin, bending over
the ground as though intent upon some
task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; exclaimed the Wind. &ldquo;Why
do you come to me with such news as
that? What difference can it make to
me what such a wretched creature as the
Ash Goblin is doing? Let him amuse
himself with his trifles as he pleases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus rebuffed, his servant retreated
shamefacedly to his post, and again the
Wind waited.</p>

<p>Such a great length of time had passed
since they had taken up their vigil at
the Chimney Mouth, that the Breezes
themselves were beginning to be uneasy,
and to suspect that by means of some enchantment
the Prince had actually escaped
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Then they bethought them of the moment
when the Elf&#8217;s door had been seen
to open and shut without anyone coming
out of it, and they were troubled, and
wondered whether they should, perhaps,
have made the matter known to their
master at the time.</p>

<p>Finally, one of their number, bolder
than the rest, summoned up his courage
and went and told the Wind of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; shrieked the Wind, rising in
a tempest of rage. &ldquo;Can it be that you
saw anything so important as this and
brought me no word of it? Magic has
been at work! This Prince has without
doubt escaped me. Even at this instant
he may be upon the Plain under the very
eyes of my watchers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurling the messenger from him, the
Wind rushed down to the Chimney
Mouth. He buffeted to right and left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>the Breezes who stood there, and whirled
out upon the Plain to see for himself
whether or not what he suspected was
true.</p>

<p>It so happened that Prince Ember and
the Shadow Witch were crossing the
Plain directly in front of the Chimney
Mouth at that instant.</p>

<p>Then what the Elf of the Borderland
had feared immediately came true. The
keen eyes of the Wind pierced the spell
of the Weaver elf. His rough blasts
shattered it. Snatching the fairy Cloak
from the shoulders of the travelers, he
beat it quickly back into the loose ashes
of which it had been woven, and drove
them off and away into the wide spaces
of the Borderland, there to settle down at
last wherever they would.</p>

<p>Thus were Prince Ember and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>Shadow Witch revealed to the gaze of
their most powerful enemy.</p>

<p>The Prince needed none to tell him
who this new foe was, nor did he quail at
sight of him, though he knew that he
might well fear for his companion and
himself. Quickly he thrust the Shadow
Witch behind him, and with his Sword
of Fire in his hand awaited his coming.</p>

<p>With a loud howl the Wind was upon
them. Against this terrific onset the
Prince held firm, and as the Wind
dashed himself upon the Sword, thinking
to wrest that from him, also, it leapt
to life, a broad and beauteous sheet of
scarlet flame, that rose in an ascending
barrier high and yet higher at every buffet
that it sustained. The more the Wind
flung himself upon it in fury, the
greater it waxed in power and brilliance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>the stronger the heat that flowed from it
in mighty waves.</p>

<p>Cowed by it, the Wind retreated for a
moment, but seeing that the flame waned
when he did so, he took fresh courage
and raged against it once more. Yet
quite in vain. Wielding his Sword with
steady hand, protected by its wall of
leaping fire, its rampart of glowing heat,
the Prince met him at every turn dauntless
and unharmed.</p>

<p>Still farther back stood the Shadow
Witch, her tall form swaying in the blasts
of the Wind. At his advance her black
hair streamed behind her like a cloud;
her grey garments and long grey sleeves,
illumined by the red glory of the
Sword, billowed round her like floating
banners. Through the fierceness of the
fight her voice was heard cheering the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>Prince sweetly, that his courage might
not fail.</p>

<p>So the battle raged: on the one side with
unavailing fury, wild shouts, insolent
boasting, and slowly wasting strength;
on the other hand with steadfast courage,
quietness and undimmed confidence.</p>

<p>For long the Wind could not believe
it possible that he would be vanquished,
but gradually he was convinced that the
foe whom he had despised was invincible.
Humiliated and sullen, he determined
to give up the losing fight. With
one last shriek of rage and discomfiture,
that rang out to the farthest confines of
the Plain and echoed across the Borderland,
he fled back in haste to the Chimney,
and hurled himself into its depths.</p>

<p>Prince Ember put up his Sword. The
Shadow Witch stole to his side to thank
him for this new deliverance, but her exceeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>gratitude made her dumb. She
could only lay her hands in his, and look
into his beloved face in silence.</p>

<p>Knowing what was in her heart,
Prince Ember bent to her. &ldquo;Dear Lady
of the Shadows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to serve you is
my highest joy. And now there is no
other enemy left for us to dread. I have
but to lead you home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith</span> what happiness Prince Ember
and the Shadow Witch resumed
their journey! All the way before
them seemed a way of brightness,
though it led across a Plain as grey and
desolate as it had been before; but they
knew that no perils lay in wait for them,
and that every step led them safely on.</p>

<p>While the Shadow Witch talked gaily
with the Prince, she turned to him a face
as radiant as though a light shone
through it from within. Ever and again
her laughter rang out low and clear, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>the echoing, mocking laughter, known
so well to the evil fairies of that land, but
a laugh of rippling music, as if all sweet
sounds, all gentle whisperings of the fire
were caught up and gathered into it.
The Prince listened to it with keen delight.
Of all the notes of gladness that
he had ever heard, it was to him the loveliest;
and she herself, gliding tall and
beautiful beside him, he could never tire
of gazing upon.</p>

<p>They came at last to the Land of
Shadows. Its pale trees and gardens lay
before them, and in the distance they saw
the Palace of Shadows lifting its grey
towers against the sky.</p>

<p>They had spoken less and less frequently
as they drew near it, and the
laughter of the Shadow Witch had
ceased, for her heart had grown heavy,
and her mind was filled with troubled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>thoughts. Soon Prince Ember would
leave her to return to his own home in
that fair land which she so much longed
to behold. He had left it to come to her
deliverance, and at first sight of him she
had known that her heart&#8217;s love could
never be given to anyone but him. That
he loved her in return, she did not doubt.
His eyes had said it, the tones of his voice
had revealed it a hundred times. Had
he not called her more than once his
&ldquo;dear Shadow Witch,&rdquo; and given himself
to danger for her sake again and
again?</p>

<p>Yet he said no word of taking her
home with him&mdash;of making her his
bride; and so her eyes were sad, and her
heart was full of pain at the thought of
the parting which was now so near at
hand. She did not dare to speak, lest her
grief should break forth uncontrolled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>Who was she, she told herself, the mischievous
Shadow Witch, a creature of
grey magic, to be the bride of such a one
as this bright, this glorious Prince,
whose magic was all noble, whose land
was all joy and brightness? In her mind
she had no picture of that land. She had
seen only Prince Radiance and his
White Flame and this Prince Ember, yet
she could guess from these, its bright inhabitants,
how marvelous the Land of
Fire must be.</p>

<p>She bowed her head humbly as she
thought of it. Its greatest glory, its
noblest Prince could never be for her
but she was determined that when he had
gone from her, she would forsake
her own home and would seek the confines
at least of the Land of Fire, and
there live in a little of its brightness&mdash;there
learn what she could of its good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>magic. This much she must do, for her
old life, her old ways, were now more
than ever intolerable to her.</p>

<p>Prince Ember, seeing her silent,
guessed nothing of her thoughts. To
him she was most dear and beautiful, the
only one whom he could ever wish to
win.</p>

<p>They had reached the foot of her
garden, and the Prince stood still. The
Shadow Witch paused also, and waited
in silence.</p>

<p>Prince Ember took her hand and
kissed it. &ldquo;Lady of the Shadows,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;we have come at last to your domain
in safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch caught her breath
painfully, for she felt that the moment
of farewell had come. It was as if she
could not bear it.</p>

<p>The Prince drew yet nearer. &ldquo;Dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>Shadow Witch,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I cannot
leave you, so do I love you, yet I cannot
stay with you here in this grey land.
Go with me, then, to my own bright
country. Go with me, there to be my
bride and princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answering words rose to the lips
of the Shadow Witch. Her face was
turned away, and her eyes hidden. But a
moment since she had been silent because
of overmastering sadness. Now,
for very joy, she was dumb. In her humility
she dared not grasp at once at the
happiness held out to her.</p>

<p>The Prince leaned to her in fear, lest
he should have been mistaken, lest perhaps
she did not love him as he had
hoped and believed. &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; he besought
her. &ldquo;Ah, speak, my dearest.
How can I go without you? How can
I leave you in this land&mdash;a land too sad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>and grey for such a one as you? All the
brightness of my own country is without
meaning for me henceforth, if I have not
you to share it with me as my heart&#8217;s true
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wooed thus, the Shadow Witch hesitated
no longer. She turned to him in a
flood of love and longing. She stretched
her hands to him, trembling with the fulness
of her joy, and her voice came
again. &ldquo;Prince of my heart,&rdquo; she murmured
softly. &ldquo;Most dear and glorious
Prince, where could my home be ever,
if not with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Ember caught her to his heart,
and silence fell once more between them.</p>

<p>For a little while they tarried in the
borders of the garden, clinging to each
other in their first great joy, and the dim
alleys and dusky trees took on a brightness
till now unknown to them from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>these two figures radiant with a pure and
innocent love.</p>

<p>At last the Shadow Witch remembered
all that she must leave behind.
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said, and her voice was
very gentle, &ldquo;I have been long gone, and
my servants still wait for their mistress.
They love me and are faithful. They
will mourn for me when I have left them&mdash;Creeping
Shadow most of all. I must
bid them farewell and tell them why it
is that I depart from them to return no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they left the confines of the garden
and turned their steps toward the Palace
of Shadows. They had not yet reached
it, when its mistress saw a pale figure
approaching through the tall shrubs that
lined their way.</p>

<p>It was Creeping Shadow, stealing
sadly along the paths once dear to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>mistress, thinking of Prince Ember who
had promised succor, a promise which
she had begun to fear he had not been
able to keep. &ldquo;Alas! what hope could
there be after all?&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;that
this Prince should be able, single-handed,
to meet and conquer such
powerful enemies as the Wizard, and his
many evil friends?&rdquo; She shook her head
doubtfully, yet even as she did so she
lifted her eyes to look once more along
the familiar path by which she had
hoped her mistress might return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; exclaimed the Shadow Witch
to her lover. &ldquo;She comes, my good and
faithful servant, still seeking, still hoping!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment Creeping Shadow
saw her and gave a loud cry that rang
through the spaces and reached even to
the palace halls. She rushed to throw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>herself at the feet of her mistress, to clasp
her knees in an ecstasy of thankfulness
and rejoicing. &ldquo;Mistress, dear mistress!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;At last, at last,
you are here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now from the palace doors and
from everywhere, the Shadows came
gliding swiftly, to burst into exclamations
of joy when they saw, in their turn,
who it was that had come.</p>

<p>Among them came the traitor, Black
Shadow, hastening to learn whether
what she had believed to be impossible,
had, in spite of her treachery, been
brought to pass. She saw Prince Ember
and her mistress surrounded by the welcoming
Shadows, saw that her plots had
been in vain.</p>

<p>She would have turned at once to flee
to the Wizard, to make known to him
what had happened, had she not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>arrested by the voice of her mistress
speaking strange words, words such as
she had never thought to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to show you that I am
set free,&rdquo; said the Shadow Witch, &ldquo;have
come, also, to bid you, my loyal servants,
farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur of astonishment went up
from the listening Shadows. What
could such words mean?</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch continued. &ldquo;I
have found light and joy and true happiness
by the side of this good Prince,
and I can no longer pass my days in this
grey land of mine with its grey magic.&rdquo;
She would have spoken further, but a
burst of sorrow interrupted her. With
one accord her servants swayed mournfully,
and with sobs and cries, cast themselves
at her feet.</p>

<p>She looked upon them with love and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>compassion. What could she do for
them, these faithful friends and servants,
whom she must leave if she followed her
dear Prince? Go she must, but what
could she say to comfort them? A thrill
of pain went through her heart, tempering
her exceeding joy in her new-found
happiness.</p>

<p>Prince Ember came to her help. &ldquo;The
light and gladness of the Land of Fire
is forbidden to none who are true and
faithful,&rdquo; he proclaimed. &ldquo;Let all, then,
who love their mistress, follow her to her
new home, if it is their wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words, so comfort-bringing,
the Shadow Witch turned upon her
Prince a glance of tenderest gratitude.
The Shadows, hearing them, were lifted
at once from deep grief to boundless rejoicing.
They rose to their feet, their
grey robes all a-flutter. &ldquo;Ah, generous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>Prince,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;we follow, follow&mdash;happy
indeed to be her faithful servants
still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All but Black Shadow. She alone had
given no cry of grief, she alone had
shown no sign of joy. She had prostrated
herself with the rest at the feet of
the Shadow Witch, and had bowed her
head, but merely to conceal the anger
which she felt at the sight of her mistress
safe returned. No sound passed her lips
now. She was glad to hear of the coming
departure, but that gladness, also,
she would restrain. Until her mistress
had gone, she would keep her own counsel,
hide her own purposes, so that she
might fulfil them in her own time and
in her own way.</p>

<p>She had not long to wait, for Prince
Ember&#8217;s voice, clear and gracious, rose
once more. &ldquo;Let us not tarry. My bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>kingdom awaits its Prince, who has
been long absent. Its good fairies will
rejoice to welcome not him alone, but
his bride and her devoted followers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying he took the hand of the
Shadow Witch, and together they left the
Garden of Shadows, and set out for the
Land of Fire. Behind them trooped the
Shadows, eager to behold for themselves
that beauteous fairyland which was
henceforth to be their home. But Black
Shadow was not among them. As soon
as Prince Ember had ceased to speak,
she had slipped quietly away.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch had noticed her
absence and presently, turning to see
what had become of her, saw a dark figure
hurrying toward the Wizard&#8217;s Cave.
It was Black Shadow. A smile of understanding
dawned upon the face of the
Shadow Witch. She said no word, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>she guessed the treacherous part that her
servant had already played, and what she
now meant to do. &ldquo;Let her go her way,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;She can harm us no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prince Ember was thinking
of his great debt to the Elf. It was
in his mind to stop at his dwelling, as
they passed through the Borderland, and
thank him for the service which the
Cloak of Ash had rendered. But he had
no need, for the Elf, espying the travelers
from afar, came to meet them. He
gave them warm greeting and listened
intently while Prince Ember told him all
that had befallen them and whither they
now were bound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, for your marvelous Cloak!&rdquo;
the Prince said regretfully in closing.
&ldquo;When the Wind tore it from me he resolved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>it to ashes and scattered it far and
wide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Elf smiled. &ldquo;That does not surprise
me. You know that I told you
something of what might come to pass.
Forget not, however, that the secret of its
weaving still dwells with the elves of the
Borderland, who will never refuse to
provide another if need arises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched his pudgy hand to the
Shadow Witch, who caught it gratefully
in both her own. &ldquo;Ah, good and kind
friend!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;What do I not owe
to your faithful friendship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; responded the Elf heartily,
looking into her lovely face, &ldquo;I am
already well rewarded by seeing you restored
to liberty, and in knowing of the
happiness which is to be yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then their farewells were spoken, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>the Elf stood watching them till they
vanished from his sight.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Black Shadow had
reached the Cave of Darkness, and there
she found the Imps still at the entrance.
They had awakened and were now rubbing
their eyes confusedly and whispering
to each other their fears concerning
what might have happened while they
had slept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little need have you now to guard
this Cave mouth,&rdquo; Black Shadow flung
at them as she passed. &ldquo;The Prince,
whose entrance it was your duty to prevent,
has long since come and gone, taking
with him the Shadow Witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not stay to reply to their frightened
and excited questions, but sped
straight to the Cave Hall.</p>

<p>There she found the Wizard sitting
upright in his chair, though he looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>pale and exhausted. He was surrounded
by the Imps who had been imprisoned
in the vaulted chamber, and who, when
the Shadow Witch had reached her own
land and the spell of the Sword of Fire
had been lifted, had heard their master&#8217;s
voice calling to them for help. They
had come in trembling haste, and found
him limp and prostrate on the floor, but
with their help, he had at last been enabled
to rise slowly and go to his accustomed
seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Wizard!&rdquo; cried Black Shadow,
addressing him without ceremony, &ldquo;the
stranger prince has everywhere prevailed!
Curling Smoke is scattered!
The Ash Goblin is defeated! The Wind
in the Chimney has been put to naught!
And now, Prince Ember has departed
to the Land of Fire, taking with him
your sister to make her his bride. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>her went all her servants, the Shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; snarled the Wizard,
scowling fiercely upon her. &ldquo;I care not
what becomes of them, so that they return
no more to trouble me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; continued Black Shadow,
&ldquo;have come to say that I mean to take
your sister&#8217;s domain for myself, and
choose companions to occupy it with me
who will obey my commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what you will,&rdquo; he retorted impatiently,
&ldquo;so that you, too, go from me,
and leave me in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Black Shadow needed no second bidding,
but left the Wizard there, with his
Imps clustered about him, while she departed
in haste to carry out her long
cherished plans.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> King Red Flame&#8217;s garden it was
brilliant noonday. The trees waved
their branches to a cloudless sky, the
flowers lifted their beauteous heads in a
clear and golden light. Through the
blossoming shrubs, the towers and walls
of the Palace of Burning Coals glistened
in fullest splendor. Prince Ember
and the Shadow Witch approaching, beheld
them shining as if in welcome. The
band of Shadows caught their breath in
wonder at the glorious sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>Within the palace sat King Red
Flame on his jeweled throne, listening
to his daughter, the Princess, as she sang
the songs he loved. Prince Radiance,
close beside her, listened also. He could
never tire of that exquisite voice, which,
from the first hour that he had heard it,
had enchanted his ear, and enchained his
heart. The Fire Fairies, busy in palace
and garden, paused now and then to
catch the floating strains, for their Princess
was unspeakably dear to them, and
her singing stirred them always to deep
delight. Rushing Flame, the King&#8217;s
messenger, poised alertly at the palace
gate in readiness to leap forth on any
errand for his master, strained his ear,
that he, too, might miss no note of her
song.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from below the palace windows,
the sound of many feet was heard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>and the air was rent by shouts of welcome.</p>

<p>The Princess broke off her song.
With one accord the royal company
started to their feet, certain that naught
but the return of Prince Ember could
cause so great a tumult. At that very instant
the scarlet figure of Rushing Flame
appeared before them, proclaiming,
&ldquo;Your Majesty the King, Prince Ember
has returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he was yet speaking, Prince
Ember and the Shadow Witch entered
the palace hall. Close after them glided
the band of Shadows, and accompanying
them came the Wise One, kind old
Grey Smoke and a multitude of Fire
Fairies, who had come quickly together
from everywhere, eager to have a part
in greeting the unknown guests, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>hear the adventures of the brave young
Prince.</p>

<p>With a lover&#8217;s pride, Prince Ember
led his beloved to the King. Never had
the Shadow Witch looked more beautiful.
Her ebon hair fell like a rich cloak
over her grey robes; her cheek was
mantled by a crimson flush; her dark
eyes gleamed with a soft radiance.</p>

<p>King Red Flame, won by the first
glimpse of this lovely stranger, forgot
his state and went to meet her. Without
waiting for his nephew to make her
known, he drew her to himself in cordial
greeting. &ldquo;Welcome fair Princess
of the Shadows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and welcome,
also, to your train.&rdquo; Then to his nephew
he turned in deep affection. &ldquo;Welcome,
dear Ember, thrice welcome. Long
have we waited and anxiously hoped for
your safe return.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>&ldquo;Welcome, welcome,&rdquo; cried Prince
Radiance heartily, coming to clasp
hands with the Prince and his companion
in his turn. Right glad was he
to see his good friends once more.</p>

<p>The gentle Princess White Flame,
thinking of what she must have endured,
took the Shadow Witch to her arms and
kissed her as a sister might.</p>

<p>Then did the King demand to know
the story of their adventures, and a deep
hush fell over the assemblage while
Prince Ember related everything, from
first to last, that had befallen them. Of
all who listened with deep interest and
earnest sympathy, only Prince Radiance
and Princess White Flame, who themselves
had once journeyed in that far-off
land and had met its perils, could fully
understand how great the task of Prince
Ember had been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>The Wise One, hearing how his own
gifts and his advice concerning the Elf
of the Borderland had been the means
of bringing them safely through all the
dangers that had threatened them,
smiled and nodded his head approvingly,
as was his wont.</p>

<p>When, in conclusion, Prince Ember
made known that he had won the love
of the Shadow Witch, and that she had
consented to become his Princess, King
Red Flame was greatly pleased that the
Prince had found so fair a mate and
gave command that the wedding should
take place forthwith.</p>

<p>In haste, then, the wedding feast was
prepared. Dame Grey Smoke herself
saw to it that it lacked no splendor that
fairy hands or fairy skill could devise.
The Wise One gave sage advice and
from his treasure chest brought gifts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>ancient and rare. The Fire Fairies vied
with one another in their loving task of
making all things ready, and among
them moved the Shadows, their faces reflecting
the joy of their mistress, their
hearts filled with wonder and delight at
the beauty and goodness of this new
fairyland into which they had come to
dwell. The Fire Fairies showed them
every kindness, so that they might feel
at home in a country where all things
were strange to them.</p>

<p>So, in the Palace of Burning Coals,
Prince Ember and the Shadow Witch
were married, and King Red Flame
himself gave the bride away.</p>

<p>When the wedding feast with its
splendors was ended, the Prince led his
bride home to his Palace of Good Cheer.</p>

<p>His own fairies stood to welcome
them. On the high golden gate that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>overarched the entrance to his dominions
three great marriage torches were
set, that lifted their quenchless flames
upward with pure and golden light.</p>

<p>As Prince Ember advanced with the
Shadow Witch through that bright gate,
she became transformed, for all grey
forsook her trailing robes forever and
left them robes of glory, robes of rose
and amethyst and richest scarlet in their
changing hues. The garments of her
attendant Shadows changed, also, and
became a soft reflection of the fuller
loveliness of her own.</p>

<p>They came on through the shining
avenue, amid the welcoming shouts of
the Ember Fairies and reached the Palace
of Good Cheer. From every turret
flaming banners floated, from every
window ruddy light beamed out.</p>

<p>At its wide open door Prince Ember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>bent and kissed his bride tenderly.
&ldquo;Enter, dear Shadow Witch,&rdquo; he whispered
low. &ldquo;Enter, and crown my life
with the priceless treasure of your love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face alight with happiness, she
passed in with him. She had come at
last, with her beloved Prince, to the
fairyland of good magic&mdash;to the land of
her heart&#8217;s desire.</p>
